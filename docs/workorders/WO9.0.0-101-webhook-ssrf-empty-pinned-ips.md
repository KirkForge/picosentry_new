# WO9.0.0-101 — Serve: Webhook SSRF bypass via empty `pinned_ips` from `_load_webhooks` (DNS-rebind guard disabled)

**Series:** WO9.0.0 (audit round 2026-08-23)
**Status:** OPEN
**Owner:** (unassigned)
**Priority:** P0 · Effort S · Risk M
**Scope:** `picosentry/serve/services/webhooks.py`, `tests/serve/`

**Gate:** `bash scripts/test.sh fast` + test: a webhook loaded from the DB whose hostname no longer resolves to a non-empty IP set is NOT dispatched (guard rejects empty `pinned_ips`), and a webhook whose dispatch-time resolve returns empty is rejected.

## Objective
`WebhookManager._load_webhooks` (line 126) sets `pinned_ips = resolve(urlparse(url).hostname or "") or []` with NO empty-check, unlike `create()` (line 156: `if not pinned_ips: raise ValueError`). When `resolve` returns `[]` (empty list, not None) — e.g. a transient DNS blip between the `_is_safe_webhook_url` probe (line 121) and the `resolve` call (line 126), or a hostname that resolves to an empty record set — the webhook is loaded with `pinned_ips=[]` (an empty list, NOT None). At dispatch time, the DNS-rebind guard (line 250) is `if webhook.pinned_ips is not None and not current_ips.issubset(allowed_ips)`. With `pinned_ips=[]` (not None) and `current_ips=set()` (DNS dead at dispatch), `set().issubset(set())` is `True`, so the guard does NOT block, and `requests.post(webhook.url, ...)` proceeds with NO IP restriction. An attacker controlling the webhook hostname (or racing a DNS rebinding) can redirect the POST to an internal IP (127.0.0.1, 169.254.169.254) that was never SSRF-checked at dispatch time.

## Evidence (verified 2026-08-23, explorer; live repro + airtight file:line chain)
- `webhooks.py:126`: `pinned_ips = resolve(urlparse(url).hostname or "") or []` — NO empty-check (unlike create()).
- `webhooks.py:155-157`: `create()` guards `if not pinned_ips: raise ValueError` — the guard exists but is missing from the load path.
- `webhooks.py:248-250`: dispatch guard `current_ips = set(_resolve_hostname(parsed.hostname) or [])`; `allowed_ips = set(webhook.pinned_ips or [])`; `if webhook.pinned_ips is not None and not current_ips.issubset(allowed_ips)`.
- `webhooks.py:250`: `webhook.pinned_ips is not None` is `True` when `pinned_ips=[]` (empty list is not None), so the guard runs but `set().issubset(set())` is `True` → no block.
- Live repro (`/tmp/opencode/test_webhook_e2e.py`):
  ```
  Webhook(pinned_ips=[]) -> dispatch with current_ips=set()
  guard_blocks = (pinned_ips is not None) and (not set().issubset(set())) = False
  => dispatch proceeds to requests.post with NO IP check: YES (BYPASS)
  ```
- Confirmed `_load_webhooks` has the `or []` guard but NO `if not pinned_ips` check (`/tmp/opencode/test_webhook_load2.py`):
  ```
  Line 126 has 'or []' guard: True
  Line 126 has empty check: False
  ```

## Deliverables
1. Add `if not pinned_ips: logger.warning(...); continue` in `_load_webhooks` (line 126-127) — skip loading a webhook whose hostname resolves to empty at load time, mirroring `create()`'s guard.
2. Harden the dispatch guard: reject when `not webhook.pinned_ips` (empty) OR `not current_ips` (empty at dispatch) — an empty pin set must never satisfy `issubset`. Change line 250 to `if not webhook.pinned_ips or not current_ips or not current_ips.issubset(allowed_ips):`.
3. Regression test per the gate.
