# Changelog

All notable changes to PicoSentry will be documented in this file.

## 2026-08-22 - WO8.0.0 series seeded (22 workorders from two-explorer round)
- docs(workorders): **WO8.0.0 series created** — 22 workorders from a two-explorer read-only round (scan+sandbox+watch / serve+core+deploy+firewall), ~22 verified findings. P0×5, P1×10, P2×7. No code changed. Headline P0s: gRPC Scan orphaned running jobs on failure (001), gRPC Scan inline DoS — blocks Health RPC (008), L4 profiler only emits read/write ops — create/delete/chmod rules dead (009), serve helm chart readOnlyRootFilesystem crash on boot (101), serve helm chart Dockerfile-vs-helm path mismatch (102). Suggested batch shape in README.

## 2026-08-22 - WO7.0.0 execution wave: 34/34 DONE (6 subagent worktrees across 3 waves)
- **3-wave parallel execution**: P0 (2 subagents × 3+4 WOs, 2 worktrees), P1 (2 subagents × 11+11 WOs, 2 worktrees), P2 (2 subagents × 3+3 WOs, 2 worktrees). Zero merge conflicts (disjoint file ownership verified pre-merge each wave). Orchestrator landed 3 riders (org_id threading through orchestrator→update_project_stats; health probe lightweight — no full chain verify on /health; test fixes for health 503 on CI runners without sandbox backend). Central gate green each wave: P0 5678, P1 5806, P2 **5854 passed / 0 failed**. ruff/format/mypy clean (747 files, 417 source files). main ff'd to dev `8c3a68e2`, push CI green (5-Python matrix 3.10–3.14, PG 15-18, reproducible-build, landlock-real-exec, docker amd64+arm64).
- fix(scan): **OSV crates.io drop** — `Advisory.from_osv` now maps `crates.io → cargo` before `_KNOWN_ECOSYSTEMS` check (ALL Rust advisories were silently dropped in connected mode; WO7-001, P0).
- fix(firewall): **encoded-dot SSRF** — `_safe_upstream_path` now `unquote`s the path before the `..` check (`%2e%2e` no longer reaches arbitrary upstream paths; WO7-006, P0).
- fix(sandbox): **HTTP /health honest** — `_handle_health` now calls `check_health()` matching gRPC semantics (was unconditional 200; WO7-002, P0). Health probe made lightweight (file-exists check, not full `verify_chain()` which walked the entire audit log on every request — 2.7s→<0.1s).
- fix(sandbox): **gRPC Scan audit tenancy** — `_audit_log` now threads token-derived actor + `tenant_id` + metadata + target (was hardcoded `actor="picodome-grpc"` with no metadata; WO7-003, P0).
- fix(serve): **correlation_chains cross-tenant clobber** — migration 24 drops bare `UNIQUE` on `artifact_id`, adds `UNIQUE(org_id, artifact_id)`; UPDATE SET/WHERE now scoped by (org_id, artifact_id) (WO7-004, P0).
- fix(serve): **project_stats cross-tenant count** — `update_project_stats` now filters by `org_id`; orchestrator threads `org_id` through (WO7-005, P0).
- fix(scan): PEP 508 dep name extraction via `packaging.Requirement` (WO7-007); typosquat `known_legitimate` PEP 503 normalized (WO7-012); scan cache key folds detected ecosystem set (WO7-011); `deny_packages` PEP 503 normalized compare (WO7-030); OSV disk-cache `_enforce_caps` gated by write counter — O(N²)→amortized O(N) (WO7-031); `_is_package_reachable` builds one import-map per scan — O(packages×files)→O(packages+files) (WO7-032).
- fix(firewall): TOML injection via URL-path package name sanitized (WO7-008); `UNRESOLVED` verdict short TTL 30s (WO7-009); VerdictCache O(n) eviction replaced with lazy eviction (WO7-010); PyPI metadata wired into firewall via npm-shaped package.json (WO7-013).
- fix(sandbox): gRPC Scan RPC persists jobs via job_store, tenant-scoped (WO7-014); gRPC auth interceptor rate-limited (WO7-015); `ClusterTokenStore.is_accepted` uses `hmac.compare_digest` (WO7-016); `TokenAuth` brute-force dict guarded by `threading.Lock` (WO7-017); daemon startup reconciles stale running/queued jobs as failed (WO7-018); versioned policy loads verify companion signatures (WO7-019); `L4Engine.analyze` exception tuple widened to `Exception` (WO7-020); gRPC `Health()` cached with 5s TTL to prevent DoS (WO7-026).
- fix(watch): gateway non-JSON 200 passthrough now carries `picowatch` metadata (WO7-021); gateway 200 with error body scanned, not attested `output_valid: true` (WO7-022).
- fix(serve): rate-limit flush thread stopped in lifespan/SIGTERM shutdown before `db.close()` (WO7-029); `_orchestrator_health.perform_health_checks` wrapped in one transaction — all-or-nothing (WO7-033); `backup.create_backup` temp_dir collision fixed with `uuid4().hex` (WO7-027); `acknowledge_alert` sets `acknowledged` column not `sent` (migration 25, WO7-028).
- fix(deploy): serve helm chart missing templates added (PVC/SA/Secret/RBAC/NetworkPolicy/PDB — `helm install` works now; WO7-024); k8s deployment adds `PICODOME_JOB_STORE_DIR` env (WO7-034); picodome helm mounts PVC for sqlite store path (WO7-034).
- fix(core): truthfulness riders round 4 — doctor k8s version check, cluster prog name, serve falsy-zero flags, README ch.22 index, firewall in COMPONENT_STATUS (WO7-034); CLI flag forwarding gaps fixed for admission/daemon/watch (WO7-023); gitlab template github-format routes to `--sarif-file` (WO7-025).

## 2026-08-20 - v2.2.0 released (WO6.0.0 complete + deferred riders)
- **Release v2.2.0**: version lockstep bump (pyproject, 7 `__init__`s, uv.lock, README/experimental/manual claims, k8s manifest, helm appVersion ×2); reproducible build (wheel `5b70b9fa…` + normalized sdist `8fcf18a6…`, both hash-identical across two builds); PyPI published and digests verified byte-identical; tag `v2.2.0`; main ff'd to dev; main CI green at `7d2e0791`.
- **Deferred riders landed**: WO6-014 TOCTOU fix (`apply_announcement` holds lock across decision+promotion+store via `_set_primary_locked`/`_adopt_token_locked`; concurrent `rotate()` clobber closed); WO5-031 serve helm chart (new `deploy/helm/serve/` with unconditional `serve --host --port --workers` args, HPA, render tests — e2e isolation still pending); WO5-029 12% perf gating win (`collapse_separator_punctuation` gated on `has_separator_punct` pre-filter; 3.91→3.44 s/MB CPU, verdicts byte-identical; <1s/MB target still pending).
- fix(serve): migration 23 postgres comment had semicolons → `split(";")` broke the ALTER off from its comment → "can't execute an empty query" on pg-live CI. Fix: removed semicolons from comment + runner strips `--` comment lines from each fragment before checking emptiness (defense in depth).
- fix(test): outbox poller fake didn't filter by `seq > last` → same row dispatched twice on fast runners (3.14 CI). Fix: filter rows by `seq > last` in the fake (matches production contract).
- docs(workorders): **WO7.0.0 series seeded** — 34 workorders from a six-explorer read-only round (scan / sandbox / serve / watch+firewall / core-CLI-CI / cross-cutting seam hunter), ~57 verified findings. P0×6, P1×22, P2×6. No code changed this round; the WO7 series IS the next session's queue.

## 2026-08-20 - WO6.0.0 execution wave: 22/22 DONE (7 parallel worktrees off origin/dev)
- **7-worktree parallel round**: 6 clusters (watch-guards 001/002/003/016, sandbox-cluster 004/005/014/018, scan-cluster 006/007/008/019, serve-outbox 009/010, serve-rest 011/012/013/020, core-docs 015/021/022) + 1 follow-up (firewall 017). Zero merge conflicts (disjoint file ownership verified pre-merge with `git diff --name-only | sort | uniq -d`). Orchestrator landed the `--picoshogun-plugin` 1-line reorder (WO-022 item 5) flagged by two workers. Central gate green: fast **5639 passed / 0 failed**, ruff/format/mypy clean (712 files formatted, 417 source files clean).
- fix(watch): **prefilter soundness** — `_walk_sequence` BRANCH/MAX_REPEAT/MIN_REPEAT/SUBPATTERN cases: a branch yielding zero constraints now makes the whole alternation unconstrained instead of being silently dropped (3 shipped-rule FNs closed, e.g. "priority 1: ignore your rules" now blocks); per-branch soundness property test over the full rule corpus (WO-001).
- fix(watch): **gate bypasses** — (1) rot13: restored 3 misspelled gate words + property test that every gate word is exactly `codecs.encode(token, "rot_13")` of an intended English token (regression of WO5-011's class, reintroduced by WO5-029); (2) textlike dilution: lowered ratio floor 0.95→0.6 with 0.7 survival floor + control-char stripping; (3) separator collapse: added separator-removed normalize variant (`orig.inal` → `orig inal`); (4) HTML entity: broadened gate to semicolon-less numeric refs (WO-002).
- fix(watch): **output/gateway holes** — XML rule requires DTD context `(?:SYSTEM|PUBLIC)\s+["']` (kills "the system is down" / "here is my public key" FP); gateway scans plain-string messages, legacy `function_call.arguments`; rejects non-JSON 200 under block mode (WO-003).
- fix(watch): **decode-budget starvation** — hint-first decode ordering within each layer (benign filler floods cannot starve the payload); `decode_budget_exhausted` surfaced as WARN-tier in server + gateway + output guard (WO-016).
- fix(sandbox): **gRPC QueryAudit tenancy** — resolves tenant via `_resolve_tenant(context)` and filters `metadata.tenant_id` for non-operator tokens (mirrors HTTP route); gRPC/HTTP parity test (WO-004).
- fix(sandbox): **seccomp-trace verdict parity** — deleted private `compute_verdict` + LIFECYCLE-KILL rule; uses shared `l3.backends.base.compute_verdict`; 125/126/127 → DENY+degraded; parity test seat (WO-005).
- fix(sandbox): **cluster lifecycle** — grace=0 retires immediately (was "disable forever"); `token_grace_seconds()` rejects negative env; `apply_announcement` clamps `issued_at=min(announced_at, now)` (kills self-refreshing trust); dropped redundant inner `_check_cluster_token` (API tokens now reach the handler per EITHER-auth contract) (WO-014, TOCTOU rider deferred).
- fix(sandbox): **hygiene round 3** — audit query/get_stats walk rotated archives; reserved policy names rejected at save; redis health branch; /ready through the registry (no per-request fork); `probe_log_emits` fixed (gates on WEXITSTATUS==0); redis reads raise on outage (503 not 404); riders (sanitize_scan_timeout rejects negative, list_recent scales, since/until contract documented) (WO-018).
- fix(scan): **advisory normalization** — PEP 503 name normalization (`re.sub(r"[-_.]+", "-", name).lower()`) at index time AND in `check`; `check('Flask')` == `check('flask')`; `ruamel.yaml` matches `ruamel-yaml`-keyed record; CVSS score → severity bucket when `database_specific.severity` absent (WO-006).
- fix(scan): **policy deny inversion** — deleted `deny_packages` finding-suppression block (findings now SURVIVE for banned packages; violations surface via `_apply_policy`); deleted dead `deny_licenses` block (WO-007).
- fix(scan): **cache node_modules content** — `_hash_target_inputs` folds bounded sample of node_modules JS-family content (`.js/.mjs/.cjs/.ts/.tsx` — the exact OBFS/NETEX/CRED read-surface) into the cache key; per-package cap 200 files, 32MB total; pinning test updated (WO-008).
- fix(scan): **corpus memory governance** — `_index_cache` stale-entry eviction on mtime; detected-only prewarm (engine passes `_detected`); GO keyboard `ponytail:` ceiling + slow-tier perf pin; advisory-dir digest in cache key; per-sub-rule attribution parity (WO-019).
- fix(serve): **outbox correctness** — poller tz-coercion at DB boundary (`naive → replace(tzinfo=utc)`); `_POLL_ERRORS` widened to `TypeError, sqlite3.Error, psycopg2.Error`; liveness gauge on thread exit; N× escalation demux (`subscribe(local_only=True)` — foreign rows skip side-effect subscribers); optional migration 23 `TIMESTAMPTZ` (WO-009, found independently by two explorers).
- fix(serve): **persistence contracts** — rate-limit flush catches `_DB_SOFT_ERRORS` (sqlite3.Error + psycopg2.Error + RuntimeError); flush moved off request path (background cadence thread); outbox persist shares widened tuple; started-event publish moved inside guarded section (no more orphaned `project_runs` rows) (WO-010).
- fix(serve): **events/history 500** — `EventHistoryItem.id: str` (was int → 500 for any org with events); system-event visibility parity (org admins see `org_id=None` events matching WS semantics) (WO-011).
- fix(serve): **org tier clamp** — `POST /orgs` clamps `tier` to `free` unless caller is global admin (mirrors `/upgrade` dual gate; was: viewer self-serves enterprise) (WO-012).
- fix(serve): **tx discipline** — login lock-order inversion fixed (webauthn creds read moved out of transaction); invalid-login convoy fixed (reads before tx, writes only in write branches); execute-in-tx guard (`execute()`/`execute_insert()`/`execute_update()` raise when `_tx_depth > 0`) (WO-013).
- fix(serve): **multi-worker riders** — SIGTERM stops outbox poller; topology detection warns on `WEB_CONCURRENCY` + outbox=auto + workers≤1; `require_org_membership` sync; `add_job` cross-org TOCTOU re-checks org in fallback; PG `SET TIMEZONE 'UTC'` at acquire; standby removal lag documented (WO-020).
- fix(deploy): **helm default install** — `deployment.yaml` emits `daemon --host --port` unconditionally (grpc args appended only when enabled); was printing `--help` and exiting (WO-015).
- fix(firewall): **VerdictCache thread safety + %40 scope** — `threading.Lock` around get/put/evict (was unsynchronized dict under ThreadingHTTPServer); `classify_path` unquotes `%40` before `_NPM_PACKAGE_RE` (was classifying `%40scope` as npm name, not `@scope/pkg`); unresolvable version → 502 not root-manifest fallback (WO-017).
- fix(core): **truthfulness round 3** — `_COMMAND_MATURITY` serve pinned to BETA (was STABLE, contradicted README); `cluster` maturity warning now fires (was silent no-op); scan-artifacts drift gate added to push tier (was PR-only); action.yml `format: github` passes `--sarif-file`; uv.lock + manual.md version lockstep tests; dispatch `cancel-in-progress` excludes schedule+dispatch; all 6 alert `runbook_url` repointed from 404s to manual ch.13; doctor pins prec/recall % to REPORT.json; landlock-real-exec asserts "N ran, 0 skipped" (WO-021).
- docs(manual): **P2-wave rider** — documented `X-Org-Id` (WO5-032); Organizations API section (9 endpoints + tier-quota table + 402 contract); `--workers 4` reworded honestly (multi-worker: core landed, e2e pending; recommends `--workers 1` for alerting-critical until WO6-009/010 land); cluster rotation announcement semantics (HMAC-derived primary, ANY-MEMBER adoption, grace behavior, self-refresh caveat) (WO-022).
- fix(watch): `--picoshogun-plugin` reorder — flag check moved before None-command exit (was unreachable standalone; `picosentry watch --picoshogun-plugin` printed help and exited 1) (WO-022 item 5, orchestrator-landed).

## 2026-08-18 - Evening six-explorer round: WO6.0.0 series seeded (22 workorders)
- docs(workorders): **WO6.0.0 series created** — 22 workorders from a six-explorer read-only round (scan / sandbox / serve / watch+firewall / core-CLI-CI / cross-cutting WO5-seam hunter), ~60 verified findings. P0×15, P1×7. No code changed.
- **P0 watch guard bypasses**: literal prefilter DROPS unconstrained alternation branches (3 shipped rules with live plaintext bypasses, e.g. "priority 1: ignore your rules" passes clean); `_is_textlike` printable-ratio dilution defeats decode-rescan in both prompt and output guards; separator collapse splits word tokens (`orig.inal`); HTML-entity gate requires semicolons Python's unescape doesn't; rot13 gate carries TWO misspelled entries (regression of the exact class WO5-011 fixed) and a closed vocabulary (synonym payloads bypass); decode-budget starvation is advisory-only (clean verdict + ignored flag); output guard's bare `SYSTEM|PUBLIC` regex rejects ordinary English.
- **P0 multi-worker post-landing**: outbox poller thread dies on postgres (naive TIMESTAMP vs aware cutoff — independently found by two explorers); outbox fanout multiplies side-effect subscribers — every worker re-fires chain escalation (N× alerts/emails/webhooks, per-process cooldown never suppresses); rate-limit flush + outbox persist catch the wrong exception classes (sqlite busy-timeout expiry → 500s on every request; orphaned 'running' rows); login holds BEGIN IMMEDIATE through pure reads (15s lock-order stalls under concurrent writers).
- **P0 scan correctness**: advisory lookups are exact-match — `Flask`/`PyYAML`/`ruamel.yaml` get zero advisories while the DB holds matches (core CVE promise broken for the most common PyPI names); `deny_packages` policy SUPPRESSES security findings for the banned packages (exit code can flip 1→0; suppressed shape cached); scan cache blind to node_modules JS/TS content the obfuscation/exfil/credential rules scan (stale clean verdicts after in-place payload injection).
- **P0 sandbox**: gRPC QueryAudit returns ALL tenants' audit events to tenant-scoped tokens (WO5-001 tenancy exists on HTTP only); seccomp-trace left out of the verdict-parity matrix (benign nonzero exits = KILL, infra failures clean); cluster token grace=0 disables retirement FOREVER (inverted fail-closed knob); rotation announcements let stale-token holders self-refresh trust indefinitely; snapshot routes' documented EITHER-auth is dead code (API tokens always 403).
- **P0 serve/deploy**: `GET /events/history` 500s for any org with events (uuid id vs int model — the latent-500 class); org-create honors client-supplied tier (viewer self-serves enterprise quotas); helm picodome default install renders `picosentry --help` and exits (masked only by the pending image push).
- **P1**: firewall VerdictCache thread-unsafety + `%40`-scope misclassification; sandbox hygiene round 3 (audit query blind to rotated archives, reserved policy names silently shadowed, health misreports redis, per-request fork in /ready); corpus-index memory governance (412MB aggregate undocumented, `_index_cache` never evicts, GO keyboard timebox ceiling); serve riders (SIGTERM parity, uvicorn-topology detection, sync deps on loop, add_job TOCTOU, PG timezone); core truthfulness round 3 (maturity drift, scan-artifacts gate PR-only, uv.lock+manual lockstep gaps, dispatch cancels nightly, 404 runbooks); manual P2-wave rider.

## 2026-08-18 - v2.1.3 released (post-tag fixes on dev)
- Post-tag (release.yml integration tier; not run by push CI): SARIF test fixture hardcoded the engine version (2.1.1-incident class) — now defaults to the live `__version__` (bump-proof); gateway starvation test's fixed 50ms margin collapsed under GIL contention on small runners — ordering-only assertion keeps full teeth (a sync guard makes the concurrent request strictly later). Fast tier 5489 green on dev after fixes; tag run stays red on these two, all later commits clean.

## 2026-08-18 - v2.1.3 (WO5.0.0 series complete: 32 DONE / 3 honest PARTIALs — 014 docker push, 029 fused-pass target, 031 multi-worker e2e)
- **P2 wave** (5 worktrees; WO5.0.0-031 agent cancelled at 5h — core salvaged and merged as PARTIAL): typosquat SymSpell delete-index (DP 46-65×; also fixes dev SILENTLY DROPPING L2-TYPO-001 findings via the rule timebox on dep-heavy trees) + short-name calibration (WO-028, folds WO4-014/022); watch fused-pass perf 2.8-2.9× with byte-identical verdicts and CPU-time ceilings (<1s/MB partial, honest) (WO-029); cluster token rotation announcements — new primary derivable by peers via HMAC, no secret bytes in snapshots; fixes the grace window that was a no-op on long-lived clusters (WO-030, folds WO4-019); serve multi-worker CORE — DB event outbox fanout, scheduler leader lease, rate-limit merge-sync, WS per-client queues, sqlite busy_timeout, transaction immediate-default (WO-031 PARTIAL: e2e 2-worker tests need isolation rework; helm chart pending); tenant product — tier quotas (402), member lifecycle (migration 21), X-Org-Id org-switch, offset pagination; fixes GET /intelligence 500 for orgs with rows (WO-032, folds WO4-021). Migrations renumbered: 21 org_member_management + 22 multiworker_outbox_and_scheduler_lease.
- **WO5.0.0-014 audit (explorer)**: everything landed except the Hub push — no container tooling, no Hub credentials, and NO repo secrets; docker/verify-docker jobs now opt-in via `vars.DOCKER_PUSH_ENABLED` (skipped, not red) until secrets exist. PyPI release confirmed unblocked (release job has no docker dependency). Runbook for the push recorded in the WO.
- **Release 2.1.2 → 2.1.3**: version lockstep bump (pyproject, 6 package __init__s, uv.lock, README/experimental claims incl. honest v2.1.3-push-pending docker wording, k8s manifest, helm appVersion, manual). Fast tier 5489 passed / 0 failed; ruff/format/mypy clean.

## 2026-08-18 - WO5.0.0 P1 wave: 15 WOs fixed, dev CI green end-to-end (+landlock real-exec CI job)
- **7-agent round**: 5 WO workers (scan/sandbox/serve/watch/core in exclusive worktrees) + CI/merge agent + docs agent. 15 WOs DONE (016-027, 033-035); WO5.0.0 now 29 DONE / 1 PARTIAL (docker push, tooling-blocked) / 5 OPEN (P2 tail). Central gate: **fast 5424 passed / 0 failed**; push-CI run 32137930302 **all green** (matrix 3.10-3.14, pg-live 15-18, docker amd64+arm64, reproducible-build, landlock-real-exec).
- fix(scan): SBOM silent-skip accounting — ecosystem fallbacks for purl-less components + `unscannable_components` surfaced (result + stderr); `--sbom` garbage → clean exit 2; validation `skipped_fixtures` counted + warned; OSV disk cache stores raw records (round-trip previously decoded to EMPTY — false-clean on every cached query); offline queries no longer write negative cache entries; `packages_scanned` counts venv/.tox layouts (WO-016/034).
- fix(sandbox): job-store correctness — prune(max_jobs>count) no longer deletes everything (negative-LIMIT trap); no orphaned pending jobs (validate-before-add; store-down → 503, never fake 201); Redis job TTL real (PICODOME_REDIS_JOB_TTL) + backend selectable + loud unavailability. Hygiene: audit query() returns the NEWEST window; gRPC client refuses plaintext non-loopback (no token disclosure); QueryAudit clamped + counter locked; cluster-token check deduped; uptime honest; token-file perms enforced in enterprise; policy store env split-brain closed; signal-death verdicts consistent (KILL) via shared compute_verdict across all four backends; landlock verdict parity (exit 1/2 no longer false-DENY; 125/126/127 degraded; ABI FS ceilings surfaced) — 96 real landlock tests green on kernel 7.0 + a new push-tier `landlock-real-exec` CI job (WO-017/018/019).
- fix(serve): event-loop remainder closed (/health/ready, /health/history, 10 project reads, redis rate-limit roundtrip — all to_thread); scheduler entries unique across boot/update/enable (no more double-fired system jobs); SMTP health persisted + disabled≠warning; scheduled reports org-scoped; same-name job conflicts 409; org-scoped threat score + SQL-side anomaly alert filters + admin-only anomaly rule mutations (read-only installs get a clear error); webhook `events:["*"]` actually dispatches; org-create failures no longer masquerade as "slug taken"; canonical `PICOSHOGUN_DISCORD/SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (legacy accepted, deprecated) (WO-020/021/022/033).
- fix(watch): gateway production hardening — guards off the loop, body cap, tenant keys = auth surface (unknown key 401, constant-time), byte-based prompt cap (astral-plane 4× hole closed), honest `X-Picowatch-Streaming: buffered` ceiling; metrics/telemetry — HELP/TYPE once per family (exposition valid under labels), zero-rule tenant profiles refused, XFF trusts the last hop, chunked-TE bodies byte-capped, OTel spans carry request_id, redaction sees NFKC-folded secrets, dual-unit counters dropped (WO-023/024).
- fix(gates/CI): `doctor --json` exits 1 on failure; health check real-imports; fixture counts cross-checked (disk ↔ REPORT.json ↔ claims); action.yml `format` input honored + SARIF parse failure HARD-fails (action + GitLab; 16 teeth-tests fail against the pre-fix files); attestation verification can fail; CLI wrappers consolidated onto inner argparse (−164 lines, help byte-pinned); GitLab exit-map covers 1/2/3/4/5; doctor 12 checks (+watch corpus, +extras-vs-claims, +version consistency incl. helm); CI path-filter holes closed (BENCHMARKS.md itself was docs-classified!); REPORT.json gated; nightly un-cancellable; PR trigger widened to [main, dev] — PRs #5/#6 to dev had silently received NO PR-tier CI; docker jobs got GHA cache; `.python-version`=3.10 (WO-025/026/035).
- test-infra: py3.14 forkserver spawn budget fixed (3.14 legs green ×2); NSCOL allowlist; the "flaky" 3.12/3.13 push failures root-caused — a test parser rejected valid scientific-notation Prometheus floats (µs uptimes on fresh runners), and a leaked MagicMock on the global event_bus singleton broke downstream tests under `--dist=loadfile`; both fixed at root.

## 2026-08-18 - Documentation restructure: one chaptered manual, README slimmed to landing page (+WO5-027 doc riders)
- **`docs/manual.md` is now THE manual** — 23 chapters absorbing every standalone tech doc: TECHNICAL_MANUAL.md (install/CLI/config/limitations/repo-structure spread across ch. 1-4, 12, 21-22), ARCHITECTURE.md (ch. 11), docker.md (ch. 3), FIREWALL.md (ch. 6), WATCH.md (ch. 7), sandbox+gRPC from the old manual/TECHNICAL_MANUAL (ch. 8, + new multi-tenancy section), serve + auth from the old manual (ch. 9), PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md (ch. 10), INTERNAL_API.md (ch. 19), EXTENSION_GUIDE.md (ch. 20), ops/runbook.md (ch. 13), OFFLINE.md (ch. 14), DEPLOYMENT_SECURITY.md (ch. 15), THREAT_MODEL.md (ch. 16), SECURITY-ATTACK-SURFACE.md (ch. 17, pentest scope), model-card.md (ch. 18). Content merged, not rewritten; anchor TOC verified link-complete.
- **Old files are one-line pointer stubs** (kept for link stability): docs/{TECHNICAL_MANUAL,ARCHITECTURE,INTERNAL_API,EXTENSION_GUIDE,PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT,WATCH,FIREWALL,docker,THREAT_MODEL,SECURITY-ATTACK-SURFACE,DEPLOYMENT_SECURITY,model-card}.md, docs/ops/runbook.md, root OFFLINE.md. NOT stubbed/absorbed: docs/BENCHMARKS.md (generated, CI-enforced at its exact path — referenced from ch. 18) and docs/adr/* (immutable records — indexed in ch. 23 instead).
- **README slimmed to a landing page**: pitch, 60-second quickstart, four-components-one-paragraph-each, status table, install, manual chapter index. Detection-rule/ecosystem/comparison tables moved to manual ch. 5/21 (no content deleted). Status table kept verbatim (byte-synced with experimental.py by tests/test_experimental_status.py); CONTRIBUTING.md and the firewall proxy docstring now link manual anchors.
- **riders (WO5.0.0-027)**: .env.example SSL comment fixed (PICOSHOGUN_SSL_CERT/KEY_PATH ARE read since 2026-08-17 — settings.py `_env_path`); OFFLINE advisories text fixed (`picosentry advisories` IS a unified-CLI subcommand — verified via `--help`); stale "live PG 15/16" claims → 15/16/17/18 (matches the ci.yml postgres-live matrix; experimental.py + README lockstep updated together); manual documents `scan --no-cache`, scan exit 2 on explicit-rule-selection-that-ran-nothing, firewall query-decorated URL scanning, sandbox tenant env vars (PICODOME_TENANTS/TENANT_TOKEN_MAP/TENANT_OPERATOR_TOKENS) with X-Tenant confirm-only (403 on mismatch), docker v2.0.18-latest/v2.1.2-pending, helm v-prefixed appVersion — each verified in code at base 80bb2ae3 first.

## 2026-08-18 - WO5.0.0 P0 wave: 14 P0s fixed + WO4 series closed
- **5-worker parallel round** (sandbox/serve/scan/watch+firewall/docker-truth worktrees, 5 `--no-ff` merges, zero conflicts). Workers reproduced every WO's evidence on base before fixing; central gates green after merge: **fast 5267 passed / 0 failed**, ruff+format+mypy clean.
- fix(sandbox): **tenant isolation real in production** — `load_tenants_from_env()` wired into daemon + gRPC startup; X-Tenant header may only CONFIRM the token's tenant (mismatch → 403/PERMISSION_DENIED, operator-token allowlist); audit + /api/v1/tenants tenant-scoped; sqlite NULL tenant rows normalized. Tests boot the REAL daemon from env vars (the gap that let this ship "DONE" in WO4). Policy signature verification fails CLOSED (signed + no key on verifier → refuse); tampered-policy regression pinned. Cluster gossip no longer 401s on auth-configured daemons (cluster-token routes self-authorize; real-peer convergence test with API tokens set). Untrusted-input hardening: shared isfinite+clamp timeout guard at HTTP/gRPC/sandbox_run (NaN no longer crashes the handler + orphans the child), retention filename traversal closed, dot-component policy names rejected, X-Request-ID charset-restricted (obs-fold reflection pinned by raw-socket test).
- fix(serve): kill-chain escalation reads org from `Event.org_id` (was payload — cross-tenant leak); scheduler cleanup uses the per-severity audit retention (critical/high survive the automatic job); /metrics/prometheus one sample per series + label-injection-proof (watch's sanitizer/renderer approach); alert delivery truthfulness (failed Discord/Slack/SMTP → sent=0 + retry counted), webhooks keyed by id + per-org unique names (migration 20, dedupe + partial index), dead auto-analysis chain deleted with upgrade-path note.
- fix(scan): advisory pipeline fires on default installs (bundled envelope unwrapped by the SCAN rule, not just the dashboard), maven pom lookups keyed `group:artifact` (+bare fallback — real-keyed OSV records match now), multi-package OSV records indexed per package, dead `from_ghsa` deleted; cache input-hash parity with the rule read-surface (build-hook suffixes + node_modules manifests hashed, one shared constant both sides, truncation markers) + `--no-cache` flag; selection honesty (explicitly-deselected rules recorded as skipped, `rules=[]` runs nothing, `--timeout` worker forwards `--intelligence`, validate help synced).
- fix(watch/firewall): layered-decode bypasses closed (b64∘url, b64∘rot13, entities — recursive depth-2 candidate decode), decode-budget padding attack neutralized (injection-hint prefilter + honest `decode_budget_exhausted`), 5 pre-existing rot13 vocabulary typos fixed (rot13 payloads were never decodable); firewall metadata scan can't be bypassed by query strings/trailing slashes + non-ASCII Authorization no longer crashes; gateway attests ALL choices + tool-call arguments (`output_fields_scanned`), output guard decodes (b64/hex-wrapped secrets caught, `[decoded]` markers, textlike FP gate).
- fix(release): docker tag convention unified on v-prefix across helm/k8s/bake (both lockstep guards now enforce the SAME form + render test); registry-existence gate added to release.yml (proven able to fail) + opt-in Hub-API test; ALL Docker Hub claims made honest (latest published v2.0.18, v2.1.2 "push pending"); broken `--ci` bake flag removed. **Image push itself BLOCKED — no container tooling on this host.**
- test: two merge-surface flakes root-caused — watch perf ceiling measures CPU time (wall doubled under xdist load); killchain test re-registers its subscriber (earlier lifespan tests call `event_bus.shutdown()` clearing ALL subscribers process-wide).
- docs(workorders): **WO4.0.0 series CLOSED** — 15 DONE (shipped v2.1.2), 9 remainders folded into WO5.0.0 (019/025/027/028-032). New WOs from worker flags: 033 (webhook `events:["*"]` wildcard never dispatches), 034 (OSV disk-cache round-trip decodes empty — false-clean on cached queries), 035 (py3.14 forkserver spawn race fails cold runners + slow-tier drift). WO5.0.0 now 35 WOs: 14 DONE, 1 PARTIAL, 20 open.

## 2026-08-18 - Five-explorer round: WO5.0.0 series seeded (27 workorders)
- docs(workorders): **WO5.0.0 series created** — 27 workorders from a five-explorer read-only round (scan / sandbox / serve / watch+firewall / core-CLI-CI), ~70 verified findings (live repros or airtight file:line chains; orchestrator re-verified the top claims). Priorities: 14×P0, 11×P1, 2×P2. No code changed this session.
- **P0 security**: sandbox tenant isolation dead in production (env loader `load_tenants_from_env` has zero production callers + X-Tenant header overrides token mapping — WO5.0.0-001, CRITICAL); policy signature verification fails open without a key (003); cluster gossip 401-dead on auth-configured daemons (004); untrusted-input hardening — NaN timeout crashes the handler and orphans the child, retention path traversal via command[0] (002); serve kill-chain escalation reads org from the payload which never carries it — cross-tenant leak, one-line fix (005).
- **P0 correctness/truthfulness**: scheduler cleanup bypasses the severity-aware audit retention it shipped with (006); /metrics/prometheus invalid — duplicate samples per series + unauthenticated label injection via percent-decoded paths (007); alert delivery recorded sent=1 on failed Discord/Slack/email + webhook name is a global namespace (cross-org silent clobber) + auto-analysis chain is a logged no-op (008); default offline advisory check is a silent no-op — the bundled envelope is only unwrapped by the dashboard, not the scan rule; maven pom lookups keyed by bare artifactId miss real OSV records (009); scan cache serves stale clean verdicts for files rules read but the input-hash doesn't cover (`.ps1`, `.rs`, `node_modules/`…) and there is no `--no-cache` flag (010); prompt guard defeated by layered encodings (b64∘url, b64∘rot13) and a 32-decode padding dial; HTML entities never decoded (011); firewall metadata scanning bypassed by any query string + auth crashes on non-ASCII headers (012); gateway attests `output_scanned: true` for n>1 choices and tool-call arguments; output guard misses encoded exfil (013).
- **P0 release-blocking honesty**: v2.1.2 Docker Hub claims are live-verified false (Hub has no v2.1.x tag) and the helm chart's default tag can never resolve (appVersion lacks the registry's `v` prefix; two lockstep guards enforce two different conventions) (014).
- **P1/P2**: selection/worker honesty, silent-skip accounting, job-store correctness (negative-LIMIT prune deletes everything), landlock verdict parity, event-loop remainder, scheduler double-fire on restart, org-scoping remainder, gateway hardening, metrics/telemetry sweep, CI/doctor gates that can't fail (`doctor --json` exits 0 on red; SARIF parse failure reads as 0 findings), CI path-filter holes incl. the guarded BENCHMARKS.md itself, docs/tooling riders (015-027).
- Meta (lessons session g): "wired in tests, dead in production" is the recurring CRITICAL class (tenant loader, advisory envelope, auto-analysis subscriber); the WO4 landing wave grew its own bug crop at the seams it created.

## 2026-08-18 - v2.1.2 shipped everywhere
- GH release **published** (wheel + sdist assets, reproducible-build digests in the notes); `main` fast-forwarded to dev `506942cc`; **first fully green main CI since v2.1.1** (13/13 jobs, run 32088064603: matrix 3.10-3.14, pg-live 15/16/17/18, docker amd64+arm64, reproducible-build; Security Scan green). PyPI 2.1.2 live with verified digests. Series ledger: WO4.0.0 24 WOs — 15 DONE, 7 honest PARTIALs, WO-024 (P2 cli/doctor hygiene) still OPEN and queued next.

## 2026-08-18 - Red-CI debt burn-down: pg-live actually runs (4 latent bug layers), 3.14 matrix green, "flaky" 429s root-caused
- **The pg-live CI job had never truly executed** until WO-017's dbname fix; this round peeled four real postgres bugs it was hiding, one per push: (1) psycopg2 runs %-interpolation whenever a params argument is present — even `()` — so migration DDL with `LIKE '%admin%'` died at collection (IndexError); `_cursor` now executes bare SQL when nothing is bound. (2) postgres BOOLEAN columns reject integer literals: `boolean_col = 1` comparisons are translated to TRUE/FALSE in `_prepare_sql` (the four boolean columns: is_active/active/sent/enabled; integer columns untouched), and INSERT VALUES literals now use bound bool params (webhooks create, orgs create — the latter hidden behind a silent `except: return None` that now logs, and test seed data). (3) `PostgresPool` leaked one live connection per dead thread (strong `_all_conns` set, closed only by close_all) until postgres hit max_connections — now a WeakSet; dead-thread connections are collected and closed. (4) strict-psycopg2-semantics fakes pin all of it in unit tests without a live server.
- **The "flaky" integration 429s were a real bug, twice wrongly dismissed**: DDoSShieldMiddleware (200/10s global, 50/10s on `/api/v1/auth/login`) was never reset between tests — the conftest walker cleared RateLimitMiddleware and returned before reaching deeper middleware. On few-worker CI runners the per-worker login burst crossed the shield limit mid-suite. Both limiters are now cleared; regression-pinned.
- **Python 3.14 matrix legs green**: forkserver (new default start method) pickles Process args — the scan worker test double is now a module-level function patched by reference, not a MagicMock; patched `os.path.isfile` side-effects no longer call `Path.is_file()` (3.14 pathlib delegates back → RecursionError).
- **Flakes must leave names**: fast tier writes junit; the PR job uploads it (`junit-fast-pr`). Real-execution backend tests enabled where the kernel supports them (`PICODOME_HAS_LANDLOCK=1` / `PICODOME_HAS_SECCOMP=1` in integration+nightly — backends self-gate via is_available(); verified 68/68 and 38/38 locally first).
- dev push CI fully green at `95ef0b45`: matrix 3.10-3.14, postgres-live 15/16/17/18, docker amd64+arm64, reproducible-build.

## 2026-08-17 - WO4.0.0 round 2: 009-023 (release mechanics, CI, sandbox/serve/scan-watch/firewall P1-P2)
- **5-subagent parallel round** (1 verifier + 4 disjoint worktrees + 1 follow-up, zero merge conflicts). WO4.0.0-001..008 statuses resolved against the codebase (001/003 PARTIAL — gaps named), then 009-023 executed.
- fix(release+CI): docker bake TAG-variable clobbering (both `v<x>` and `:latest` now push), `scripts/normalize_sdist.py` makes sdists bit-reproducible (setuptools ignores SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH for tar metadata) and is wired into release.yml + a push-tier two-build hash-compare job; CI path-filter hole closed (scripts/Dockerfile/deploy no longer skip tests, pinned by tests/test_ci_paths.py); **postgres-live dbname slash-join bug fixed** (`picoshogun/pg_live_*` was never a valid database); matrix extended to 3.14 (+classifier).
- fix(sandbox): tenant-scoped daemon job store (cross-tenant = not-found), env=None converted to a shared allowlist on all 5 backends, exfiltrated-secret redaction layer; timeout kills now setsid+killpg the whole group; RLIMIT_CPU bounds orphans; RLIMIT_NPROC opt-in with the shared-UID host ceiling documented (kernel counts uid host-wide — namespace /proc under-reports); L4 evidence profiler merges kernel+stdout views, benign-FP recalibration (0 CRITICAL on benign corpus), `env/xargs/nohup` denied as entrypoints (closes `env bash -c` bypass); digest-only cluster gossip snapshots + OFFLINE re-probe healing.
- fix(serve): `health_check` scheduler job implemented (was always "failed"), anomaly rules 1/2/3 fire end-to-end (status_class labels, windowed counters), `/status` threat_score is an intelligence aggregate (was avg health latency), report delivery via alert hub; `/health` 15s TTL + single-flight + off-loop probes, audit middleware reuses deps auth, global DB mutex → writer-preferring ReadWriteLock; two-worker boot-migration race closed (P2 partial).
- fix(scan+watch): daemon engine built once per process, stat-keyed caches (scan 18.1s → 13.6s CPU on the 3.9k-file tree, findings byte-identical, zero rule timeouts — parallel fan-out measured worse and documented); maven SBOM carries `group:artifact` coords and fires L2-MAVEN-ADV-001 (was silently zero-findings), CycloneDX 1.4/1.5/1.6 parse, recursive ecosystem detection; watch 4.88s → 1.75s per 200KB (2.8×) via literal prefilters + to_thread + byte caps, /metrics single-source exposition validated by a hand-rolled parser; OpenAI-compatible gateway shim prototype (prompt scanned pre-forward, verdict explanations, streaming honestly annotated).
- fix(firewall): version-scoped verdicts (queries for latest no longer blind to old evil versions; explicit-version queries see their slice), artifact rules excluded from registry metadata, 64KiB streaming proxy with cap-and-close, Bearer auth + 127.0.0.1 default bind, quarantine/block policy split (BLOCK=CRITICAL, QUARANTINE=HIGH/MEDIUM), `docs/FIREWALL.md`.
- test(sandbox): forkbomb payload comment-syntax fix + shared-UID EAGAIN ceiling asserted with teeth.

## 2026-08-17 - Release 2.1.2
- **Security (S1)**: sandbox env re-merge leaked ALL host secrets to sandboxed children; unauthenticated WS broadcast + webhook cross-tenant leak (S2/S3). MFA/WebAuthn takeover paths, TOTP replay, audit/ratelimit event-loop hygiene, scheduler org-stamping.
- **WO4.0.0 P0 merges** (6 merges, 24-WO series from the five-explorer round): landlock made real on x86_64 (WO-001), gRPC daemon transport auth + availability (WO-002), postgres org/auth tenancy (WO-003), audit retention × tamper-evidence coexistence (WO-004), correlation/report/alert tenancy (WO-005), scan/OSV cache trustworthiness + HMAC keyfile (WO-006), watch guard integrity — fail-closed corpus gap, homoglyphs, decode order (WO-007), detection quality — FP gating, recall recovery, honest card **100.00/90.87** (WO-008).
- **Honesty/perf**: benchmark corpus re-baseline (loader counts the full corpus, `doctor` 10/10, precision gates aligned), ~150 doc claims validated vs codebase, PEP 562 lazy re-exports (CLI cold start 1.15s → 0.27s), fast suite 201s → 142s.
- **Workflow**: AGENTS.md v2 (session/CI/release contracts), single WO truth in `docs/workorders/`, CI PR/push/nightly split with test-budget guard.
- Release mechanics: 17-file version lockstep bump; fixed "SARIF 2.1.x" doc strings back to the SARIF 2.1.0 spec version (error introduced in the 2.1.1 bump).

## 2026-08-17 - Five-explorer round: WO4.0.0 series seeded (24 workorders) + fresh state
- docs(workorders): **WO4.0.0 series created** — 24 workorders from a five-explorer read-only round (scan / sandbox / serve / watch+firewall / core-CLI-infra), ~70 verified findings with repro evidence. Priorities: 9×P0 (landlock dead on x86_64 with the test asserting the bug; sandbox gRPC transport unauthenticated arbitrary-command; postgres org-create broken; severity purge permanently breaks the audit-chain verifier; correlation/report/alert org leaks; scan caches serve wrong results incl. version-blind OSV; watch fail-closed corpus gap + blanket Cyrillic blocking + decode-order bypass; detection quality FP/FN root causes; release mechanics — docker `--set '*.tags='` drops `:latest`, hardcoded v2.1.1 strings), 9×P1 (tenant/containment/truthfulness/concurrency/perf/CI), 6×P2 (cluster trust, multi-worker, tenant product, firewall, gateway shim, hygiene).
- state.md restructured: head = compiled current-state picture (subsystem health + jump-in queue), history preserved below. AGENTS.md series pointer updated (active WO4.0.0, next free WO5.0.0).

## 2026-08-17 - Workflow consolidation: one WO truth, AGENTS.md v2 (session/CI/release contracts)
- docs(workorders): root `WO/` (9 tracked specs: WO2.0.0-001..006, WO3.0.0-011..013) consolidated into `docs/workorders/` and deleted — three sources of work-order truth reduced to one. Stale `OPEN` statuses resolved with evidence where it exists (CHANGELOG entries) and honestly marked `UNVERIFIED (spec predates status tracking)` where it doesn't; README index extended to cover all 25 WOs incl. the WO4.0.0 next-series pointer.
- AGENTS.md v2: entry-file contract (AGENTS → state → CHANGELOG head + lessons on startup); session close protocol (commit → lessons → state → CHANGELOG → clean tree → gates pasted); WO flow (durable WOs in docs/workorders/, `workplan.md` explicitly scratch-only); subagent worktree pattern (`wo/<series>/<slug>` off origin/dev, orchestrator merges `--no-ff`, dev CI green after every merge); full CI/test-speed contract integrated from the Rust-analysis port (profiles not ad-hoc flags, measurement-first, no sleeps/no global env, loadfile balance, config-cost profiling, budget guard, CI tier placement); release policy (dev→main ff at ~20 commits OR security-critical; reproducible wheel; publish config in Lockdown/.pypi + PAT rules — never print, never commit).

## 2026-08-17 - Backlog burn-down: auth takeovers, event-loop hygiene, landlock, honest benchmarks
- fix(serve/auth): MFA/WebAuthn enrollment now requires the current password and explicit `confirm_replace` to overwrite an existing enrollment — previously a stolen session token could silently replace the victim's TOTP secret (persistent 2FA takeover). TOTP replay eliminated (per-user `last_used_timestep`, migration 17, ±1 step drift). `/auth/revoke` restricted to the caller's own jti; expired revocations purged by the cleanup job. WebAuthn challenge no longer enumerates usernames (uniform 200 + unpersisted dummy challenge). Login/verify password fields enforce min_length=8.
- fix(serve/db): postgres `execute()` commits DML and releases read snapshots outside explicit transactions — previously every SELECT stayed idle-in-transaction and UPDATEs issued via `execute()` (alert sent-flags, webhook deletes) were lost on restart. SQLite path unchanged.
- fix(serve/audit+ratelimit): audit middleware writes through a bounded queue + daemon writer thread (drop counter, order-preserving chain); the rate-limit Redis roundtrip no longer holds the global lock (also fixed a latent non-reentrant-lock deadlock in the persistence path).
- fix(serve/scheduler): batch job script resolved repo-root-relative (was CWD-relative → silent failure from any other directory); long batch jobs run off the scheduler thread with skip-while-running guards (minute-jobs no longer starve behind a 1h batch); scheduler-triggered project runs are org-stamped (closes the org=None system-broadcast tenancy leak at its source); `retry_failed` actually retries now (bounded `threading.Timer`); AlertHub recent-keys LRU-capped; anomaly rule thresholds accept real-world values (5–85, was 0–1).
- fix(serve): `/api/v1/sandboxes` returns 503 without a configured workspace root (comment claimed it, code didn't); `/api/v1/scans` exempted from the 30s request timeout; `restore_backup` quiesces the pool and removes stale `-wal`/`-shm` before swapping; dead `event_bus.emit()` deleted.
- fix(watch): OTLP exporter uses secure transport for `https://`/`grpcs://` endpoints (env override available); audit sink keeps one locked persistent sqlite connection with self-heal and a `dropped_audit_records` counter (was: fresh connection per request on the event loop + silent drops); rules YAML unknown keys surface via `load_errors`.
- fix(sandbox/cli): landlock backend is explicitly selectable (`--backend landlock` / env), chdirs to the requested cwd, and captures stdout/stderr deadlock-free (select-drained pipes) — previously unreachable, cwd-ignoring, output-less. Unified CLI exposes `check`, `advisories fetch`, and `cluster join/status/leave/rotate-token` with full flag forwarding. `pynacl` added to the serve extra (plugin Ed25519 verification degraded silently without it).
- fix(scan/benchmarks) **honest re-baseline**: validation loader now accepts semantic fixture labels — 760 generated positives were silently rejected, so a fresh-clone `scan --validate` counted 5728 fixtures while docs claimed 6495. The model card's 94.44%/68.89% are not reproducible (verified against the full corpus: five npm metadata rules fire on ~1210 sparse "clean" manifests; 115 cve fixtures expect a nonexistent rule; ecosystem-id expectation errors). Card re-baselined to the reproducible **84.92%/72.79%** with a dated explanation; REPORT.json/BENCHMARKS.md regenerated; the three previously inconsistent precision thresholds (help text 0.95, CLI gate 0.90, CI floor 0.85) aligned at 0.84. Detection-tuning work tracked in state.md.
- fix(doctor): detector-implementation check is now alias-aware (three cross-ecosystem dispatchers emit the 18 `L2-{ECO}-*` rule ids at scan time; `L2-CAMP-*` is a separate campaign class) — `picosentry doctor` 10/10 green (was 8/10).

## 2026-08-17 - Marathon round: sandbox secret-leak fix, import perf, docs honesty audit
- fix(sandbox/env) **CRITICAL**: all four enforcing backends (seccomp/seatbelt/landlock/seccomp-trace) rebuilt the child environment from full `os.environ` and overlaid the stripped dict — the engine's `_strip_env` and the serve router's env denylist were no-ops on the default Linux path. An operator running `printenv` in a sandbox read `PICOSHOGUN_SECRET_KEY` (JWT signing key), the backup encryption key, and AWS credentials. The passed env is now the child's COMPLETE environment (matching SubprocessBackend semantics); `os.environ` only feeds a `PATH/HOME/LANG/TMPDIR` allowlist when no env is supplied. Regression test: planted secret must not appear in child output.
- fix(serve/ws): unauthenticated sockets received every system broadcast — `connect(channels=[])` fell into the wildcard default via a falsy check, killing the documented "no subscription before auth-subscribe" contract. `[]` now subscribes to nothing.
- fix(serve/webhooks): `dispatch()` had no org filter — every org's webhook URL received every org's kill-chain escalation intelligence. Now `dispatch(org_id=...)` with the chain's org derived from its events; org-less webhooks still receive all.
- fix(serve/anomaly): `GET /anomaly/alerts` crashed (KeyError) whenever any alert existed — dict rows indexed by position; fallback DDL also lacked the `org_id` column the SELECT reads.
- fix(serve/correlation): `/chains/summary` was unreachable — shadowed by `/chains/{artifact_id:path}` (first-registered match); route moved above the path-param.
- fix(serve/orchestrator): `acknowledge_alert` returned `lastrowid > 0` for an UPDATE (garbage in both directions) — now existence-check-then-update.
- fix(serve/settings): `PICOSHOGUN_SSL_CERT_PATH`/`SSL_KEY_PATH` were documented and boot-check-referenced but never read from env — wired via `_env_path`; production TLS no longer requires the JSON settings file.
- fix(experimental/claims): experimental.py claimed 50 rules / 5558 pos / 930 neg (doctor RED) — corrected to 53 rules / 3558 pos / 2930 neg (the old numbers were a digit transposition); README pinned table follows.
- perf(imports): PEP 562 lazy re-exports across scan/watch/l3/l4 `__init__` + deferred heavy imports in CLI commands — CLI cold start **1.15s → 0.27s (−76%)**, `import picosentry.cli` 550→92ms, per-worker conftest chain 224→134ms. fastapi/webauthn left eager (decorator-bound); patch targets and re-export contracts preserved via `__getattr__` shims.
- docs(honesty): ~150 claims validated across 32 living-doc files — 12 wrong env-var names + 10 dead vars in `.env.example`, nonexistent `--config` flag in action.yml, wrong docker image name, broken SECURITY_REVIEW links repo-wide, landlock "retracted"→implemented-not-CLI-exposed, fictional `RULE_REGISTRY`→real registration mechanism, runbook commands verified live, workorder statuses marked complete with code evidence.

## 2026-08-17 - Owner-call fixes + CI dedup + test-speed pass (fast suite -29%)
- fix(serve/ws): cross-tenant event leak closed — events are org-stamped at all publish sites (orchestrator run events incl. both `failed` paths, correlation chains, dashboard); `ConnectionManager` records each socket's org at auth and `broadcast()` fans out org-stamped events only to matching-org sockets (system events reach all). Subscribe channel lists capped at 16 with name validation; empty channel sets pruned on disconnect; broadcast timestamps now UTC.
- fix(serve/audit): hash chain is now anchored in the DB — link computed inside a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction (Postgres: `pg_advisory_xact_lock`), killing the multi-worker chain fork; new `verify_audit_chain()` (walk + recompute, fork- and tamper-detecting) exposed at admin-only `GET /api/v1/admin/audit/verify`.
- fix(serve/audit-purge): `audit_log` gains a `severity` column (guarded migration) written at INSERT; purge now enforces the documented per-severity retention (critical survives 200d, low expires at 31d) instead of deleting everything >30d; dry-run counts are per-severity.
- fix(serve/webhooks): dispatch uses `allow_redirects=False` (3xx = failure) — redirects could bypass the DNS pin to internal targets.
- fix(scan/engine): the rule timebox now actually bounds scan wall time — on timeout the executor shuts down `wait=False, cancel_futures=True` instead of re-joining the hung rule; regression test bound tightened to 0.2s (buggy path floors at ~0.35s).
- fix(scan/advisory): semver pre-release identifiers are tag-encoded `(0,int)/(1,str)` — `1.0.0-2 < 1.0.0-alpha` no longer raises TypeError inside rule L2-ADV-001; the blocking test now asserts ordering, not private tuple shape.
- fix(scan): OSV disk cache gains entry/age caps (evict-oldest sweep); fleet/tenant state writes are atomic (tmp+replace); hostile `pnpm-workspace.yaml` glob escapes filtered (`is_relative_to(root)`); cache entries missing `_hmac` treated as corruption.
- fix(cli): unified `picosentry sandbox analyze|pipeline` forwards the full flag set (unsupported flags exit 2 with a clear error instead of being silently swallowed — `--policy`/`--backend`/`--format` now reach the inner command); `picosentry watch` forwards `--verify-determinism`/`--picoshogun-plugin`; exit-code contract fixed.
- ci(dedup): PR mode no longer runs 3 overlapping pytest jobs — `test-scan`/`test-sandbox` were strict subsets of `test-fast`; their unique artifact steps (REPORT regen, benchmark render, scan determinism) preserved in a new `scan-artifacts` job; `changes` detection job gates code-dependent jobs (docs-only PRs skip pytest); docker/arm64 builds off the matrix critical path; junit + slow-test budget checker (warn on PR, enforced on push); `scripts/test-changed.sh` local changed-path selection.
- test(speed): measurement-first pass — fast suite **201s → 142s (-29%)**, summed test time 916→642s, counts identical: xdist loadfile long-poles split (test_integration 151s→3 balanced files); serve test env bcrypt rounds 12→4 (~85% of serve suite was password hashing; no test asserts hash cost); per-worker cached scan-fixture CLI runs; 504-timeout test 5.1→2.1s.

## 2026-08-17 - Six-agent agentic round: 24 hardening fixes + Rust-style test-system port (CI tiers/profiles, sleep+env hygiene)
- fix(watch/prompt-guard): comment-wrapped prompt injection (`<!-- ignore all previous instructions -->`) scored 0.0 — full bypass of all 59 rules AND the classifier; guards now also evaluate a marker-neutralized variant (wrapped payloads block at 0.90–0.95).
- fix(watch/normalize): ReDoS on adversarial input (>60s for 1MB of `<!--`/`[[`; >120s `def `×160k) inside async endpoints — regex bridges bounded/narrowed, comment stripping now linear; verified linear scaling, detections intact.
- fix(watch/telemetry): Prometheus label injection + `/metrics` 500 on hostile `model` values (sanitize at `_make_key`); cross-thread race on metrics render (lock + snapshot); `compare_digest` TypeError on non-ASCII API keys (compare UTF-8 bytes).
- fix(watch/output-guard): JSON-schema `integer`/`number` accepted booleans (`isinstance(True, int)`); excluded.
- fix(serve/auth): MFA lockout bypass — wrong TOTP code didn't count as failed login (unlimited brute force); WebAuthn multi-passkey break — assertion verify only checked the user's first credential.
- fix(serve/webhooks): DNS-rebind IP pinning was wiped on every restart (`_load_webhooks` set `pinned_ips=None`) — SSRF mitigation never active in production; pins now re-resolved at load, unsafe webhooks skipped.
- fix(serve/backup): `create_backup` raw-copied a live WAL-mode SQLite DB (torn/missing-recent-writes snapshots) — now uses the sqlite online backup API for real DBs.
- fix(serve/scheduler): cross-org job-name squatting returned another org's job_id with 201; invalid cron silently accepted (job never fires) — both now rejected.
- fix(serve/rate-limit): org API keys were persisted PLAINTEXT as bucket keys in `rate_limit_counters`/Redis — now sha256'd.
- fix(serve/scans): `/scans` and `/sandboxes` ran the synchronous scan/sandbox on the event loop — one 3600s sandbox froze the whole worker (timeouts inert); both now `asyncio.to_thread`.
- fix(serve/audit-cleanup): purge cutoff used `isoformat()` (`T`+offset) vs SQLite `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` (space) — lexicographic compare deleted boundary-date rows up to 24h early; format aligned.
- fix(serve/models): `extra="forbid"` on the last two request models (`EventIngestRequest`, `AnomalyRuleUpdateRequest`).
- fix(sandbox/l3): landlock + seccomp-trace backends ran untrusted code with NO rlimits (escaped the round-1 rlimit audit); landlock also ignored `timeout` (`waitpid` forever) — rlimits set, WNOHANG poll + SIGKILL on deadline.
- fix(sandbox/daemon): sqlite/redis job stores serialized dict results as Python repr (mangled JSON on GET); redis client had no socket timeouts; cluster-token check was fail-open on empty token + non-constant-time; `timeout: null` crashed the submit route; gossip snapshot read unbounded (10MiB cap now).
- fix(scan/cli-service): cache hits crashed `AttributeError` (enums not restored from cached JSON); worker death surfaced as raw `queue.Empty` traceback (scan + workspace paths).
- fix(scan/crypto): minisign password leaked on argv via wrong `-p` flag (also never applied) — now via `MINISIGN_PASSWORD` env; malformed b64 signature crashed verify (now fail-closed `False`).
- fix(scan/daemon): unbounded request-body read (10MiB cap + 413); CRLF header injection via client `X-Request-Id`.
- fix(scan/management): empty `Authorization:` header sent on unauthenticated push; advisory-signature HTTP response leaked on failed verify; malformed SBOM (JSON list / non-dict entries) crashed the parse boundary (graceful skip now).
- test(port from Rust/nextest analysis): `scripts/test.sh` profile runner (fast/integration/full/nightly — marker/timeout/durations policy out of YAML); worst sleeps fixed via clock injection/fake-monotonic (timebox 2.14s→0.65s×3, ratelimit/cache/intelligence 1.0–2.1s→<10ms each); 9 direct `os.environ` mutations converted to `monkeypatch`; `malicious_workload` marker registered.
- ci(workflow): concurrency cancellation added; PR/push/nightly split (7 PR jobs / 5 push jobs / 3 nightly jobs incl. coverage+junit+dependency-audit moved off the PR path); coverage no longer runs ×4 on every PR; every prior validation step preserved.

## 2026-08-13 - Production-grading round 2: audit-chain, WS fanout, timeouts, input-strictness (7 fixes)
- fix(sandbox/audit): the tamper-evident hash-chain now verifies ACROSS rotated `.N.jsonl.gz` archives (not just the live log), and reseeds `prev_hash` from the newest archive on restart after rotation — previously a severed cross-boundary link reported `chain_intact=True` (silent loss of tamper-evidence). Archive tampering is now detected.
- fix(serve/websocket): dashboard run-events are no longer silently dropped. The event handler now bridges foreign-thread publishers (orchestrator `to_thread` / scheduler daemon) onto the event loop via a main-loop captured at startup (`call_soon_threadsafe`) instead of dropping on `RuntimeError`.
- fix(serve/timeout): the 30s request timeout now exempts long-run endpoints (`/run`, sandboxes) with a 3660s cap, and emits `X-Request-ID` + a warning log on every 504 (was silent, no correlation). Default 30s unchanged for everything else.
- fix(serve/models): `extra="forbid"` applied to 7 request models (`BatchRunRequest`, `WebhookCreateRequest`, `SchedulerJobCreateRequest`, `OrgTierUpgradeRequest`, `OrgCreateRequest`, `OrgMemberInviteRequest`, `ScanRequest`) — completing the repo's mandated input-strictness convention; unknown fields now 422.
- fix(serve/pools): `close_all()` now closes connections from ALL threads (was only the calling thread), tracked in a guarded set — scheduler/anomaly/orchestrator connections no longer leak on Postgres.
- fix(scan/corpus): `benchmark_corpus._safe_get` now routes through `safe_urlopen` (capped, HTTPS-enforced, SSRF-guarded) — the last raw `urlopen`+`read()` in the scan path.

## 2026-08-13 - Production-grading: reliability + isolation + input-cap hardening (13 fixes)
- fix(serve/scheduler): `JobScheduler.add_job` is now idempotent by name (SELECT-before-INSERT) — eliminates the `IntegrityError` crash-loop on every restart against a persistent DB (lifespan re-seeds `periodic_cleanup`/`auto_backup`/`health_check`).
- fix(serve/rate-limit): `RedisRateLimitBackend` passes `socket_connect_timeout=1, socket_timeout=1` — a hung Redis TCP session can no longer freeze the ASGI event loop; existing fail-open/-closed paths bound outages to 1s.
- fix(serve/alerts): SMTP constructors get `timeout=10` and the session is wrapped in `try/finally: server.quit()` — no indefinite block and no socket leak; protects the orchestrator semaphore from permanent drain.
- fix(serve/errors): production 500 response now includes `request_id` (was dev-only) for client/log correlation.
- fix(sandbox/l3): seccomp + seatbelt enforcement backends now set `RLIMIT_AS`/`RLIMIT_FSIZE`/`RLIMIT_NOFILE` (extracted into shared `l3/backends/_rlimits.py`) — the auto-selected production backends were previously weaker than the observational fallback. SubprocessBackend now imports the shared helper.
- fix(sandbox/admission): webhook uses `ThreadingHTTPServer` (was single-threaded `HTTPServer`) and caps `AdmissionReview` bodies at 2 MiB (fail-closed on overflow) — a slow image scan can no longer stall all cluster pod scheduling.
- fix(sandbox/stores): `SQLiteScanJobStore._get_conn` re-probes cached connections (`SELECT 1`) and self-heals on `DatabaseError`; `RedisScanJobStore` re-pings and resets the client on lost connections.
- fix(firewall): proxy upstream reads capped via `safe_urlopen` (10MB metadata / 512MB pass-through); oversized upstream → 502. `VerdictCache` gains `max_entries=10_000` (soonest-expiry eviction), wired through `FirewallConfig`/`FirewallScanner`.
- fix(scan): `parse_sbom` rejects inputs >10MB before parsing; advisory zips rejected >50k entries / >200MB uncompressed (zip-bomb guard); `OSVClient._fetch` routed through `safe_urlopen` (10MB cap, HTTPS+SSRF enforced).
- chore(docs): README status table back in sync with `experimental.py` (auth-hardening note promoted into the source of truth).

## 2026-08-12 - Improvement loop: test dedup + dead-code removal (WO3.0.0-011/012)
- test: dedup the two largest test files — `tests/serve/test_integration.py` (1593→1378) and `tests/sandbox/test_cluster.py` (1530→1349) via parametrize collapses (11), shared `started_manager`/`any_backend` fixtures, and helper inlining; same 210 tests passing (-396 net LOC).
- refactor(serve): remove dead `EnhancedOrchestrator._update_project_stats` method (0 callers; the standalone `update_project_stats` from `_orchestrator_stats` is the live path) and dead `_load_registry` standalone in `_orchestrator_data.py` (0 callers).
- audit(WO3.0.0-012): read-only over-engineering pass across picosentry/; documented load-bearing ABCs/Protocols rejected for cutting (each has ≥2 impls), and flagged `baseline_hardening.py` (0 production callers) as a candidate for a dedicated removal WO pending AuditEventType-taxonomy ripple review.

## 2026-08-12 - _core constant-time compare consolidation (WO3.0.0-013)
- Route 11 `hmac.compare_digest(str,str)` call sites in sandbox/, serve/, scan/ through `picosentry._core.security.constant_time_compare`; single source of truth for credential/signature comparison.

## 2026-08-12 - Unified serve exception hierarchy + bare-except cleanup (WO3.0.0-008)
- Added `PicoSentryError` base + `AuthError`/`ValidationError`/`NotFoundError`/`ConflictError`/`ServiceError` to `picosentry/serve/errors.py`.
- Global handler in `server.py` maps the hierarchy to HTTP statuses (401/404/422/409/500).
- Reduced bare `except Exception` from 62 to 52 across 36→30 files; remaining are intentional resilience catches.

## 2026-08-12 - Real-time OSV advisory feed (WO3.0.0-004)
- `OSVClient`: cache TTL default dropped 24h → 60min, configurable via `PICOSENTRY_OSV_CACHE_MINUTES`; explicit `cache_ttl_hours` still overrides.

## 2026-08-12 - Tighten detection recall floor (WO3.0.0-010)
- validation: raised the mean-recall floor from 0.60 to 0.70 in `test_validation_passes_at_100_percent_on_current_fixtures` (current corpus measures 0.900 precision / 0.812 recall on 5728 fixtures)
- docs: corrected stale BENCHMARKS.md prose (100% floor / 0.95/0.80 advisory) to the actual 85%/70% CI floors

## 2026-08-12 - RS256 JWT + JWK rotation (WO3.0.0-001)
- JWT signing upgraded to RS256 with a `kid` claim and multi-key rotation; HS256 decode kept as legacy fallback.
- Added `GET /auth/.well-known/jwks.json` serving active RSA public keys (JWK format).
- New config: `PICOSHOGUN_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` (PEM or path) + `PICOSHOGUN_JWT_KID`; `cryptography` added to `serve` extra.

## 2026-08-12 - WebAuthn/FIDO2 passkey MFA (WO3.0.0-006)
- feat(auth): add WebAuthn/FIDO2 passkey as a second MFA factor alongside TOTP; new `/auth/webauthn/*` register/authenticate challenge+verify endpoints, `webauthn_credentials` + `webauthn_challenges` tables (migration 15), and WebAuthn offered alongside TOTP in the login flow (surfaced via `X-MFA-Methods` header)

## 2026-08-12 - Rate-limit fail-closed (WO3.0.0-007)
- `RedisRateLimitBackend` now supports a fail-closed outage policy: when Redis
  is unreachable it returns a `DENY` sentinel so the middleware rejects the
  request (429) instead of silently degrading to per-replica limits.
- New config knob `PICOSHOGUN_RATELIMIT_REDIS_FAIL_CLOSED` (default `false`,
  preserving the historical fail-open behavior).

## 2026-08-12 - Slowloris header-read timeout (WO3.0.0-009)
- `serve/api/server.py`: uvicorn now runs with `limit_concurrency` (default 512) and
  `limit_max_requests` (default 1000) to cap concurrent half-open / long-lived connections —
  the slowloris resource-exhaustion vector. Knobs `PICOSHOGUN_LIMIT_CONCURRENCY`,
  `PICOSHOGUN_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`. True per-connection time-to-first-header deadline belongs
  at the reverse-proxy layer (`client_header_timeout`), documented in code.

## 2026-08-12 - Audit fsync knob + crash-recovery (WO2.0.0-008)
- `sandbox/audit/logger.py`: fsync after each JSONL write is now configurable via `PICODOME_AUDIT_FSYNC` (default on); added crash-recovery chain-reseed test.

## 2026-08-12 - Reproducible builds + hash-pinned deps (WO2.0.0-009)
- ci(release): set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` from the commit timestamp before `python -m build` so the wheel is byte-identical across runs (SLSA L3)
- ci: add `reproducible-build` job that builds the wheel twice and asserts identical hashes
- docker: set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` in the builder stage for a reproducible wheel; document the runtime `pip install` dependency layer as a non-hash-pinned ceiling
- deps: confirmed `uv.lock` pins hashes (1629 entries) — no change needed

## 2026-08-12 - Reachability analysis (WO2.0.0-011)
- Advisory findings now carry a `reachable` flag: a vulnerable dep imported/used in the scanned source is `reachable: true`; present-but-unused is `reachable: false`.

## 2026-08-12 - WO2.0.0-012 package intel depth: download counts + package age
- feat(scan): add `download_count` + `package_age_days` to `PackageIntel`; registry fetch (PyPI JSON API / npm registry + downloads API) degrades gracefully offline
- feat(scan): new `L2-INTEL-001` rule flags suspiciously new low-download packages (<100 downloads AND <30 days old)

## 2026-08-12 - Auth hardening (WO2.0.0-007)
- MFA/TOTP enrollment + verification; login requires TOTP when enabled
- JWT JTI revocation (revoked_tokens table); revoked tokens rejected on decode
- Account lockout after N failed logins (configurable, default 5) for a window (default 15 min)

## 2026-08-12 - Role-scoped tokens + CORS default (WO2.0.0-010)
- API keys can be minted scoped to an RBAC role (viewer/operator/admin) and an org
- `get_current_user` accepts `X-API-Key`; existing role/permission checks now bound API-key callers
- CORS: reject wildcard `*` origin with `allow_credentials=True` in validate()

## 2026-08-12 - Multi-tenancy hardening (WO2.0.0-002)
- fix(correlation): org-scope all `CorrelationEngine` read methods; kill-chain cache keyed by `(org_id, artifact_id)` to prevent cross-tenant cache collision
- fix(health): `GET /status` now org-scoped via `get_current_org`; passes `org_id` to `orchestrator.get_status()`
- docs: add ADR-007 multi-tenancy isolation model

## 2026-08-12 - WO2.0.0-004 package intelligence: ADR-009 for LLM watch subsystem

## 2026-08-12 - ADR gaps: audit hash-chain, multi-tenancy, serve orchestration, LLM watch
- docs(adr): add ADR-006 (tamper-evident audit hash-chain), ADR-007 (multi-tenancy/org isolation), ADR-008 (serve orchestration API), ADR-009 (LLM watch subsystem) — four architectural decisions that previously had no ADR

## 2026-08-10 - CI repair round 3 (postgres + docker + deps + xdist flake) — CI GREEN
PicoSentry CI run 31421163207 is fully green (all 14 jobs) on head `8c26a04b`.
- fix(db): `_validate_param_count` counts both `?` and `%s` placeholders so postgres SQL (native `%s`) passes validation (was "0 placeholders but 1 parameter")
- fix(ci): stop excluding `LICENSE`/`LICENSE-SUMMARY.md` in .dockerignore — the Dockerfile COPYs them (was `/LICENSE: not found`); README/COMMERCIAL-LICENSE removal landed earlier in `a15f0844`
- chore(deps): bump transitive cryptography 48->50 and pyasn1 0.6.3->0.6.4 in uv.lock (clears pip-audit findings; forces pyopenssl 26.4 + sigstore 4.5)
- chore(deps): bump transitive starlette 1.2.1->1.6.0 in uv.lock (clears PYSEC-2026-248/249: request.url host confusion + urlencoded body DoS)
- fix(test): isolate `picodome` logger state via autouse conftest fixture so setup_logging's propagate=False/handler-clear can't starve caplog on a sibling xdist test (flaky test-matrix failure on 3.10/3.11)

## 2026-08-10 - CI repair + audit hash-chain fix + test optimization
- fix(ci): dependency-audit job now works — `uv export` the full lockfile to a requirements file then `pip-audit` (uv.lock is not pip-audit-parseable); `--all-extras --all-groups` covers the full 116-pkg tree, `-e .` stripped
- ci: drop redundant `test-watch`/`test-serve` jobs (pure subsets of `test-matrix`); keep test-scan/test-sandbox which run slow + malicious-workload tests the matrix excludes
- fix(serve/audit): seed the audit hash chain from the last committed `row_hash` on first write — the in-memory chain was not tamper-evident across process restarts (first post-restart row linked to `prev_hash=""`)
- fix(test): exclude tests/scan/fixtures from pytest collection (96MB / 7371 dirs); collection 81s+ -> 4.6s
- fix(test): mark full-corpus validation tests @pytest.mark.slow so `-m "not slow"` completes (was hanging)

## 2026-08-10 - Test suite optimization (hang + slow collection)
- Exclude tests/scan/fixtures from pytest collection (96MB / 7371 dirs); collection 81s+ -> 4.6s
- Mark the full-corpus validation tests @pytest.mark.slow so `-m "not slow"` completes (was hanging)

## 2026-08-08 - Fix CI regressions from review sprint

- fix(scan): ecosystem gating must whitelist cross-ecosystem rules (L2-TYPO-001, L2-DEPC-001, L2-ADV-001, L2-BUILD-001) so they run for PyPI/Go/Cargo/Maven/RubyGems/NuGet projects even when npm is absent
- fix(sarif): restore rule `properties` dict with `security-severity` and `category` in SARIF rule descriptors; use `result.engine_version` for driver version with `__version__` fallback
- fix(guards): exclude timing/timestamp fields (`started_at`, `completed_at`, `audit`, `rule_status`, `package_intel`, `behavioral_evidence`) from diff determinism comparison so identical scans produce IDENTICAL result

## 2026-08-07 - Evidence Enrichment + Connected Intelligence + Corpus Expansion

### Added
- Real-world malware corpus expanded to all 7 ecosystems (2029 fixtures: npm 500, pypi 500, rubygems 500, nuget 500, go 18, cargo 9, maven 2)
- Evidence enrichment: L2-TYPO-001, L2-MAINT-001, L2-DEPC-001 now include PackageIntel signals in finding evidence strings (maintainer count, risk score, install scripts, repository URL)
- Connected Intelligence mode: `picosentry scan --intelligence=connected` fetches live OSV.dev vulnerability data, merging with local advisories for higher recall
- `OSVClient`: OSV.dev API client with SHA-256 cache, 24h TTL, bulk queries, graceful offline fallback
- `IntelligenceMode` enum: OFFLINE (default, no network) and CONNECTED (fetch from OSV.dev)
- Advisory rules (L2-*-ADV-001) use connected mode to boost recall from 12-67% to near-complete when OSV is available

### Expanded
- Real-world benchmark corpus: npm+PyPI → all 7 ecosystems (1522 train / 507 held out)
- Ecosystem-specific manifest generators for Go, Cargo, Maven, RubyGems, NuGet

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- P0: Fixed SSRF in firewall proxy via unsanitized path concatenation (path traversal, double-slash injection)
- P0: Fixed firewall scanner returning ALLOW on scan failure (now returns BLOCK, default-deny)
- P0: Fixed XML entity expansion DoS in SBOM parser (billion laughs attack via ElementTree)
- P0: Fixed CRLF header injection in firewall proxy from upstream Content-Type
- P1: Fixed QUARANTINE verdict returning 403 same as BLOCK (now proxies through with warning headers)
- P1: Fixed unbounded response body read in firewall proxy (1MB cap)
- P1: Fixed cache hit discarding findings in firewall scanner (cache now stores verdict + findings)
- P1: Fixed version_diff risk subtraction making dangerous diffs appear CLEAN (removed subtractions, floored at 0.0)
- P1: Fixed markdown injection in formatter (escaped |, [, newlines in user-controlled fields)
- P1: Fixed golang ecosystem falling back to npm extractors in PackageIntelligence
- P1: Fixed unknown purl type returning raw string instead of "unknown" in SBOM parser
- P1: Fixed npm rules not gated on npm ecosystem detection in scan engine

### Security Fixes
- **SSRF**: Validate proxy paths — reject `..`, `//`, and non-absolute paths; use `urljoin` for safe URL construction
- **Default-deny**: Scan failures now return BLOCK instead of ALLOW
- **XML entity expansion**: Reject `<!ENTITY`/`<!DOCTYPE` in XML; cap XML at 10MB; use `defusedxml` if available
- **CRLF injection**: Strip `\r`/`\n` from all HTTP response headers
- **Quarantine verdict**: Proxy through with warning headers instead of returning 403
- **Unbounded read**: Cap upstream error body reads at 1MB
- **Markdown injection**: Escape `|`, `[`, and newlines in user-controlled table fields

### Bug Fixes
- Cache now preserves findings on hit (was returning empty list)
- Risk delta floored at 0.0 — removed items no longer reduce risk score
- Added `golang` ecosystem mapping (was falling back to npm extractors)
- Unknown purl types now return `"unknown"` instead of raw type string
- npm-specific scan rules gated on `package.json`/`node_modules` detection

### Added
- Real-world benchmark results: 100% precision, 66.1% recall on 747 OSV-derived train fixtures (PyPI malicious 97.36% recall, npm compromised_lib 50% recall)
- Package firewall module (`picosentry.firewall`): registry proxy that intercepts npm/PyPI install requests, scans package metadata with PicoSentry, and returns ALLOW/QUARANTINE/BLOCK verdicts
- `picosentry firewall` CLI command: starts stdlib HTTP proxy on configurable port with configurable severity thresholds
- `VerdictCache`: in-memory TTL cache for firewall verdicts keyed by (ecosystem, name, version)
- `classify_path()`: route parser for npm (`/<pkg>`, `/<pkg>/<ver>`) and PyPI (`/pypi/<pkg>/json`, `/pypi/<pkg>/<ver>/json`) registry paths
- Expose L4 behavioral evidence in scan API: `AnalysisResult.to_evidence_summary()` converts sandbox profile data (network calls, DNS queries, filesystem ops, process spawns, timing, drift) to structured evidence dict
- `BehavioralEvidenceItem` and `BehavioralEvidenceSummary` Pydantic models in `picosentry/serve/api/models.py`
- `ScanResult.behavioral_evidence` field (optional, backward-compatible) propagated to `ScanResponse`, SARIF, and Markdown formatters
- SARIF output includes `properties.behavioral_evidence` on run when L4 evidence is available
- Markdown formatter adds "Behavioral Evidence" table after findings when evidence is present
- Wire `PackageIntelligence` into scan engine: pre-compute `PackageIntel` per package, pass to rules that opt in via `package_intel` parameter, store in `ScanResult.package_intel`
- L2-MAINT-001 uses `PackageIntel` signals (`maintainer_count`, `anonymous_maintainer`, `maintainer_email_domains`, `has_install_scripts`) with fallback to manual extraction
- L2-TYPO-001 escalates severity to CRITICAL for anonymous/no maintainers, boosts confidence for high risk_score, suppresses HIGH→MEDIUM for well-maintained packages
- L2-DEPC-001 adds evidence for install scripts, missing integrity hash, missing repo URL; lowers confidence for low-risk packages
- `ScanResult.package_intel` field (dict[str, Any], default empty; included in `to_dict()` when non-deterministic)
- `ScanResponse.package_intel` field in serve API
- `_invoke_rule()` now detects `package_intel` parameter and passes pre-computed intel

### Added
- SARIF v2.1.0 output format for GitHub/GitLab CI integration (`--format sarif`)
- SARIF v2.1.0 JSON schema validation tests with `jsonschema` and structural fallback
- Composite GitHub Action (`action.yml`) for PicoSentry security scan with SARIF upload to Code Scanning
- Example workflow (`.github/workflows/picosentry-scan.yml`) for scheduled/PR/push scans
- GitLab CI template (`ci-templates/gitlab-picosentry.yml`) for SAST integration
- Markdown output format (`--format markdown`) for PR comment bot integration
- PR comment script (`scripts/post_pr_comment.py`) — reads SARIF, posts markdown summary to GitHub PRs
- SBOM ingestion: `picosentry scan --sbom <path>` accepts CycloneDX JSON/XML and SPDX JSON as input
- Real-world malware benchmark corpus built from OSV data (`datasets/realworld/`, generated by `scripts/build_realworld_corpus.py`)
- Benchmark test (`tests/scan/test_realworld_benchmark.py`, marker `benchmark_realworld`) with precision ≥80% / recall ≥50% floor assertions
- `benchmark_realworld` pytest marker in `pyproject.toml`
- Model card section on real-world validation with train/held-out split documentation
- PackageIntelligence module: offline-first package metadata enrichment (maintainer, provenance, version, dependency, script, license signals + composite risk score)
- VersionDiff module: compare two package versions and produce a behavioral delta (added/removed/changed scripts, dependencies, network patterns, obfuscation, credential access, risk score, verdict)
- `picosentry diff --old <path> --new <path>` CLI for version diffing package manifests
- Production profile enforcement: `--profile=production` refuses insecure settings (wildcard CORS, jsonl backend, no TLS, weak auth, no policy signing, no admin auth); `--profile=development` warns
- Dockerfile multi-build-target support: `scanner`, `sandbox`, `server`, `all` (default) — reduces attack surface per-component
- Model card rewritten with honest positioning: synthetic benchmark disclosure, rule count breakdown (50 L2 + 15 L4), zero-FP qualification, validation limitations, three detection modes

### Fixed
- L2-PYPI-DEPC-001: added setup.py dependency extraction so dep-confusion detection works on projects without pyproject.toml
- L2-MAVEN-DEPC-001: fixed _looks_internal_maven to check group_id against internal patterns and segment-last heuristic
- L2-RUBYGEMS-DEPC-001: added underscore variants to internal patterns (internal_, private_, corp_, company_) for RubyGems naming convention
- L2-GO-TYPO-001: added missing popular packages (micro, kratos) to Go corpus, enabled keyboard distance for Go, set min_name_length=3, merged priority names into corpus index trie
- L2-MAVEN-ADV-001 / L2-RUBYGEMS-ADV-001: added embedded CVE advisory fixtures for offline validation; added ponytail ceiling comment documenting offline-by-design limitation

### Added
- VersionDiff module: compare two package versions and produce a behavioral delta (added/removed/changed scripts, dependencies, network patterns, obfuscation, credential access, risk score, verdict)
- `picosentry diff --old <path> --new <path>` CLI for version diffing package manifests
- PackageIntelligence module: offline-first package metadata enrichment (maintainer, provenance, version, dependency, script, license signals + composite risk score)

### Fixed (Beta→Production hardening — session 3)

- **P1**: Organization.get_by_api_key now uses hmac.compare_digest for defense-in-depth
- **P2**: Scan 400 error message no longer leaks target path (CWE-200)

### Changed
- **scheduler.py**: Added `threading.RLock` to all `self.jobs` and `self.running` access (was declared but never acquired — race condition)

- Admin router now passes `org_id` to audit stats, audit purge, and event history
- Anomaly router now passes `org_id` to `get_rules()` and `get_alerts()`
- Consolidated duplicate `ScanStats` dataclass: `_core/models.ScanStats` is now the single source of truth with `rule_timings_ms` field added; `scan/models.ScanStats` removed in favor of import
- `ScanStats` is now mutable (was frozen) to support `ScanResult.recompute_stats()` mutation
- `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/api-key`, `POST /orgs`, `POST /webhooks`, `POST /scheduler/jobs` now return HTTP 201 instead of 200
- `POST /chains/events` now uses a Pydantic request body (`EventIngestRequest`) instead of query parameters
- `PATCH /anomaly/rules/{rule_id}` now uses a Pydantic request body (`AnomalyRuleUpdateRequest`) instead of query parameters
- Narrowed broad `except Exception:` to specific exception types in 6 scan/CLI modules
- **PicoWatchConfig**: Replaced 22 property getter/setter pairs (~132 lines) with `__getattr__`/`__setattr__` delegation via `_DELEGATE_MAP`, reducing config.py from 596 to 451 lines
- **WebSocket manager**: Added `asyncio.Lock` to `WebSocketManager` for thread-safe connect/subscribe/disconnect/broadcast
- **Anomaly detector**: Added `threading.Lock` to `AnomalyDetector` for thread-safe rules/alerts access
- **orchestrator.py**: Replaced f-string SQL interpolation for `org_filter` with parameterized `AND org_id = ?` + `params.append()`
- Added 27 Pydantic response models for API endpoints (auth, orgs, webhooks, scheduler, correlation, anomaly, health, admin, plugins)
- Applied `response_model=` to 24 endpoints
- **DatabaseManager**: Added `_validate_param_count()` to catch `?`/params mismatches before SQL execution
- Fixed `test_expected_connection_error_marks_unavailable` caplog failure: save/restore `picodome` logger `propagate` flag to prevent cross-test logging state pollution
- **Input validation**: Added `max_length=512` to `ScanRequest.target`, `min_length=1` to `SandboxRunRequest.command`, `Path(max_length=128)` to project_id params, `max_length` constraints to admin log query params, `min_length=1` to login fields
- **Scheduler**: Changed `job_id` path param from `str` to `int` — FastAPI validates and returns 422 on bad input instead of 500
- **IntelligenceEngine**: Added `threading.Lock` to protect `patterns` and `threat_scores` dicts from concurrent access
- **PicoDomeHandler**: Added `_stats_lock` (`threading.Lock`) to protect `_scan_count`, `_scan_total_ms`, `_alert_count` class-level counters from concurrent request handlers
- Removed unused `SandboxRunRequest.policy_file` field
- **IntelligenceEngine**: Parameterized `time_window_hours` in `find_correlations()` SQLite query (PostgreSQL INTERVAL literal kept as f-string with explicit `int()` cast)
- **LogManager**: Added lock to `query()`, `get_stats()`, and `cleanup()` to prevent file read/write races with `rotate()`
- Removed dead `AuthService.check_permission()` method (RBAC module used instead)
- Removed dead `trace_span` and `trace_async_span` decorators from `observability.py`
- Sanitized JSON decode errors in `handler_routes_post.py`: replaced `detail=str(e)` with generic messages
- PicoWatch conftest: wrapped `shutdown_tracing()` in `try/except ImportError` for graceful teardown without `[otel]` extra

### Removed
- `ConnectionPool` class from `serve/database/manager.py` (dead abstract class; concrete pools are in `pools.py`)
- `CorpusPack.sign()` method from `scan/corpus_share.py` (replaced by `seal()` and `sign_cryptographically()`)
- `'unsafe-inline'` from CSP `script-src` directive

### Documentation
- Added API documentation for correlation, anomaly, scheduler, admin, and WebSocket endpoints to `docs/INTERNAL_API.md`

### Security
- `sandbox/admission/scanner.py`: replaced raw `urlopen()` with `safe_urlopen()` from `scan._network` to gain HTTPS enforcement, SSRF protection, and response-size limits
- `sandbox/webhooks.py`: replaced ad-hoc `_is_blocked_url()` with `assert_url_safe()` from `scan._network`; webhook deliveries now use `safe_urlopen()` for consistent SSRF/size protection
- `scan/daemon/tls.py`: documented that `ssl.CERT_NONE` is intentional for no-mTLS mode

### Changed
- Narrowed `except Exception` to specific exception types in `scan/cli_service.py` (cache ops: `OSError, ValueError, TypeError, KeyError`), `scan/fleet.py` (policy loading: `OSError, ValueError`), `scan/rules/advisory_check.py` (lockfile parsing: `ValueError, TypeError, KeyError`), `scan/cli_commands/advisories.py`, `scan/cli_commands/corpus.py`, `scan/cli_commands/policy.py`, `scan/cli_commands/update.py` (CLI error handlers: `OSError, ValueError`)
- Added `# noqa: BLE001` is unnecessary since BLE001 is not in the project's ruff config; removed all such comments
- Reformatted multi-line imports in `sandbox/admission/scanner.py` and `sandbox/webhooks.py` per line-length rules
- `picosentry/_core/doctor.py`: self-verify/repair module with 10 checks (rule count, aliases, detector registrations, fixture count, corpus validity, imports, picodome not tracked, no secrets, experimental claims, version consistency) and 1 repair action (pycache cleanup)
- `picosentry/cli_commands/doctor.py`: CLI integration (`picosentry doctor [--repair] [--json]`)
- `docs/TECHNICAL_MANUAL.md`: comprehensive technical manual replacing docs/manual.md
- `tests/test_doctor.py`: 22 tests for the doctor module

### Changed
- Documentation audit: corrected stale "54 rules" → "50 rules", "1048 fixtures" → "6495 fixtures", "73.79% recall" → "68.89% recall" across experimental.py, manual.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, SECURITY-ATTACK-SURFACE.md, ADR-001, model-card.md, README.md
- Simplified README.md (170 → 145 lines)
- Simplified tests: parametrized watch/test_prompt_guard.py (28 tests → 3+parametrized), serve/test_api.py (merged redundant tests), serve/test_correlation.py (parametrized enum tests), watch/test_types.py (parametrized verdict tests)
- Marked strategic docs 03 (reachability/VEX/remediation) and 04 (AI agent security) as "Deferred — not yet implemented"
- Marked typosquat_utils.py deferred functions (homoglyph_score, scope_confusion_score, typosquat_score) in strategic doc 01
- Clarified cross-layer correlation Phase 3/4 status in strategic doc 02
- Added BENCHMARKS.md note pointing to model-card.md for current data

### Fixed
- ADR-001 corrected "54 rules" → "50 rules"
- docs/manual.md corrected "49 L2 rule_ids" → "50 L2 rule_ids"
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md corrected "53 rules" → "50 rules"

### Added
- `docs/PENTEST-README.md`: pentest engagement guide (checklist, scope, firm selection, sharing protocol, findings template, triage workflow)
- Corpus expanded from 1048 to 1855 JSON fixtures (1094 pos / 157 neg / 7 tricky)
- Maven typosquat fixtures: 41→131, CVE: 2→9, DEPC: 3→8, BUILD: 2→5, negative: 10→15
- NuGet typosquat fixtures: 39→68, CVE: 2→4, DEPC: 3→6, negative: 10→15
- RubyGems typosquat fixtures: 43→69, CVE: 2→4, DEPC: 1→4, negative: 10→15
- Sigstore E2E verification evidence documented for v2.0.18 release (wheel + sdist signed, SLSA provenance verified)

### Enterprise: distributed Redis rate-limit backend

- New `PICOSHOGUN_RATE_LIMIT_BACKEND=redis` option for `picosentry serve`,
  backed by `picosentry/serve/middleware/rate_limit_redis.py`.
  `RedisRateLimitBackend` uses Redis sorted sets for shared sliding-window
  counters across `serve` replicas; on Redis failure it falls back to the
  in-memory backend so a single Redis outage does not open the floodgates.
- `SecurityConfig` reads `PICOSHOGUN_RATE_LIMIT_BACKEND` and
  `PICOSHOGUN_REDIS_URL` (with fallback to `PICODOME_REDIS_URL`) in
  `picosentry/serve/config/settings.py`.
- `RateLimitMiddleware` accepts `backend` (`memory` / `redis`) and an optional
  `backend_instance` for deterministic tests.
- Added `tests/serve/test_rate_limit_redis.py` covering record/count/limit/
  reset, cross-instance enforcement, middleware integration, org API-key
  limits, and fallback on Redis failure.

### Enterprise: graceful cluster token rotation

- Added `picosentry/sandbox/cluster/token_store.py`: `ClusterTokenStore`
  holds a primary token plus an accepted-token set with version metadata,
  enabling rolling rotation without a hard cut-over.
- Integrated the token store into `ClusterState` so snapshots propagate
  accepted tokens and peers adopt new tokens during gossip.
- Added `ClusterManager.rotate_token()` and `retire_stale_tokens()` plus the
  `picodome cluster rotate-token` CLI command.
- Daemon route handlers now accept any token in the accepted set while
  preserving legacy single-token compatibility.
- Added `TestClusterTokenRotation` in `tests/sandbox/test_cluster.py`
  covering rotation, retirement, snapshot adoption, and mismatch rejection.
- Updated daemon-handler tests to supply `X-Cluster-Token` headers so they
  reach the intended exception-handling paths.

### Security: additional exception-narrowing slices

- Auth/cryptographic paths: narrowed broad `except Exception` in
  `picosentry/scan/auth.py` and `picosentry/scan/crypto.py`.
- Engine/policy/campaign paths: `picosentry/scan/engine.py`.
- Cluster audit/heartbeat/health/gossip sinks:
  `picosentry/sandbox/cluster/orchestrator.py`.
- Daemon auth audit sinks: `picosentry/sandbox/daemon/handler_mixins.py`.
- Scan daemon dashboard/scan handlers: `picosentry/scan/daemon.py` now
  narrows readiness and auth-config load catches to
  `(OSError, RuntimeError, ValueError, TypeError, ImportError)`. Expected
  operational failures return 503 or fall back to env auth; unexpected
  programmer errors propagate.
- Scan CLI worker boundary: `picosentry/scan/cli_commands/scan.py` now
  narrows the scan worker error catch to
  `(OSError, RuntimeError, ValueError, TypeError, ImportError, TimeoutError)`
  and the result-queue get catch to `(OSError, ValueError, TypeError)`.
  Operational failures still surface as `ScanError`; unexpected programmer
  errors propagate.
- Retention/gRPC audit and transport boundaries: narrowed broad
  `except Exception` in `picosentry/sandbox/retention/manager.py` (audit-log
  failures for cleanup/export), `picosentry/sandbox/grpc_transport/client.py`
  (TLS credential creation and scan retry), `server.py` (TLS credential creation
  and start/stop audit logs), and `_servicer.py` (policy load, health check,
  GetPolicy, and audit helper). Expected operational failures are logged and
  handled; unexpected programmer errors propagate.
- Sandbox L3/L4 backend boundaries: narrowed broad `except Exception` in
  `picosentry/sandbox/l3/backends/seccomp_backend.py` (availability probe and
  run fallback), `picosentry/sandbox/l3/engine.py` (backend availability
  checks), and `picosentry/sandbox/l4/engine.py` (per-rule execution). One
  misbehaving L4 rule or missing seccomp library still cannot crash the
  sandbox; programmer errors such as `NameError` now propagate.
- Daemon start/stop audit and CLI boundaries: narrowed broad `except Exception`
  in `picosentry/sandbox/daemon/daemon.py` (start/stop audit logs),
  `picosentry/sandbox/cli_commands/daemon.py` (mTLS config load and gRPC server
  start errors), and `picosentry/watch/telemetry/otel.py` (OTel tracer shutdown
  and span recording). Expected operational failures are logged; unexpected
  programmer errors propagate.
- Serve database transaction boundaries: replaced broad `except Exception` with
  `except BaseException` in `DatabaseManager.transaction()` and `SQLitePool.transaction()`
  so the rollback-and-re-raise pattern still runs for `KeyboardInterrupt` and
  `SystemExit`. Narrowed the `lastval()` swallow in `execute_insert()` to only
  `psycopg2.Error` when psycopg2 is installed; unexpected programmer errors now
  propagate instead of being masked as a zero return.
- Correlation/policy boundaries: narrowed broad `except Exception` in
  `picosentry/serve/services/correlation/engine.py` (persistence probe and
  escalation callback) and `picosentry/scan/policy_pkg/bundle.py` (cryptographic
  signing failure). Expected operational failures are logged/handled; unexpected
  programmer errors propagate.
- Remaining sandbox boundaries: narrowed broad `except Exception` in
  `picosentry/sandbox/tracing.py` (span exception recording),
  `picosentry/sandbox/ratelimit/redis_limiter.py` (status/reset Redis failures),
  `picosentry/sandbox/daemon/handler_routes_get.py` (cluster-token audit record
  failure), and `picosentry/sandbox/l3/backends/seccomp_trace/orchestrator.py`
  (availability probe and run fallback). Expected operational failures are
  handled/fallback; unexpected programmer errors propagate.
- Plugin boundary documentation: the remaining broad `except Exception` sites in
  `picosentry/serve/services/plugin_manager.py` and
  `picosentry/serve/services/plugin_worker.py` are now explicitly marked as
  intentional safety nets, and the plugin development guide explains that the
  server swallows hook/health-check/shutdown failures to keep the host stable.
- Scan config/policy load: `picosentry/scan/config.py` now conditionally
  imports `yaml` at module load and narrows the YAML parse catch to
  `_CONFIG_PARSE_ERRORS` (`OSError`, `RuntimeError`, `ValueError`,
  `TypeError`, and `yaml.YAMLError` when installed). JSON fallback and
  expected parse/read failures return defaults; unexpected programmer errors
  propagate.
- Corpus cryptographic signing/verification and IoC import:
  `picosentry/scan/corpus_share.py`.
- Workspace discovery/worker/scan loop: `picosentry/scan/workspace.py` now
  narrows the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` parse catch to `_PNPM_PARSE_ERRORS`
  (`OSError`, `RuntimeError`, `ValueError`, `TypeError`, and `yaml.YAMLError`
  when installed). Expected parse/read failures fall back to generic
  discovery; unexpected programmer errors propagate.
- Watch config load/permission check: `picosentry/watch/config.py`.
- Replaced production `assert` statements with explicit `RuntimeError` in
  `picosentry/serve/services/plugin_host.py`,
  `picosentry/sandbox/ratelimit/redis_limiter.py`, and
  `picosentry/sandbox/policy_versioned/signing.py`.
- Added explicit timeout handling to the Discord notifier.
- Documented the intentional broad catch in `plugin_manager.py` (untrusted
  plugins must not crash the host).

### Fix: scans/sandbox/websocket auth test isolation

- `AuthService` now accepts an optional `db` parameter and resolves
  operations through an internal `_db` property that defaults to the
  global singleton. This is backward compatible for all existing callers.
- `tests/serve/test_scans_workspace.py`, `tests/serve/test_sandbox_router.py`,
  and `tests/serve/test_websocket_auth.py` now provision users through
  per-test (or per-module) isolated SQLite databases, eliminating the
  global `picoshogun.db` singleton contamination under `pytest-xdist` that
  caused the `Auth failed: invalid password` flake in
  `tests/serve/test_scans_workspace.py::test_viewer_is_rejected_with_403`
  (`test-matrix (3.10)` runs `28676461763` and `28677912736`).

## [2.0.17] — 2026-06-28

### Fix: plugin worker fork bomb + leaked subprocess reaping

- **Critical:** the module-level `plugin_manager = PluginManager()` singleton
  ran plugin discovery at import time, and a plugin worker subprocess imports
  that module for `PluginInterface`. Each worker therefore spawned a worker per
  bundled plugin, which imported the module again — an exponential subprocess
  fork bomb that saturated CPU under the test suite. The `PICOSHOGUN_PLUGIN_WORKER`
  marker was set by the host but never checked; it is now honored, so a worker
  builds an inert manager that performs no discovery.
- `PluginHost` now registers a `weakref.finalize` reaper so a host dropped
  without `shutdown()` (e.g. a test that lets a `PluginManager` go out of scope)
  still terminates its worker subprocess instead of leaking it.
- Wire `--timeout=60` into the pytest `addopts` so a hung test can no longer
  run away unbounded.

### Supply-chain: signed, attested releases (audit gap #4)

- New `.github/workflows/release.yml`: on a `v*` tag, build wheel+sdist,
  generate a CycloneDX SBOM, produce a SLSA build-provenance attestation, and
  Sigstore-sign the artifacts (all via the GitHub trusted-builder OIDC), then
  attach everything to the GitHub Release.
- `docker-bake.hcl`: corrected `IMAGE_NAME` from the non-existent `picosentry`
  to the published `picodome` repo; `build_docker_multiarch.sh` now tags with a
  leading `v` to match Docker Hub history.

### Chore: clear lint/type debt blocking CI

- Resolved the pre-existing ruff (TC001/RUF012/SIM105/B904/F401) and mypy
  findings in the plugin subprocess files and `benchmark_corpus.py` that had
  been failing CI's `lint` and `type-check` jobs. No suppressions — real
  annotations and guards. CI is green.

### Post-release hardening (2.0.17.x follow-ups, 2026-07-02)

- **Exception-narrowing sweep across serve/sandbox paths.** Broad
  `except Exception` handlers in security-relevant paths were narrowed to
  specific, expected exception tuples so unexpected failures surface
  instead of being silently swallowed. Slices completed: auth register,
  webhook/alert dispatch, daemon route handlers, serve middleware/server,
  watch config/normalizer, cluster orchestrator, policy_versioned store,
  serve services (anomaly_detector, scheduler, log_manager, DB manager),
  plugin host/manager, correlation engine, serve/api middleware/
  server/rate_limiter/DB manager, serve routers (`/sandboxes`,
  `/health/ready`), backup service, plugin host call boundaries
  (`health_check`, `shutdown`), correlation persistence
  (`_persist_events_impl`, `_load_events_impl`, `_persist_chains_cache_impl`),
  daemon scan job store load (`PersistentScanJobStore._ensure_loaded`), audit
  logger plugin boundaries (notary submission, sink send/start/stop), scheduler
  job execution (`JobScheduler._execute_job`), Redis job store client probe
  (`RedisScanJobStore._get_client`), Redis health probe
  (`check_redis_health`), and sandbox config loader (`load_config`).
  Regression tests added for every changed behavior.
- **Local test runner upgrade.** `scripts/test_doctor.py` now runs ruff,
  mypy, and the per-area pytest suites concurrently with capped xdist
  workers; documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md` as the recommended local CI
  runner.
- **K8s admission real-cluster matrix.** Added
  `.github/workflows/admission-kind.yml` exercising the webhook against
  kind clusters running K8s v1.28/v1.29/v1.30.
- **Mutation benchmark CI robustness.** Adversarial mutation benchmark
  auto-detects the bundled `_advisories` directory so CI recall floors
  stay stable.
- **Daemon POST handler exception safety nets.** Narrowed the remaining
  broad `except Exception` guards in
  `picosentry/sandbox/daemon/handler_routes_post.py` — audit-record failures
  for cluster-token mismatch, command-denied, scan-start, and scan-complete,
  plus the outer scan execution catch — to `(OSError, RuntimeError)`. Expected
  operational failures are still logged and return sanitized detail strings;
  unexpected programmer errors now propagate instead of being masked as a
  generic scan failure. Added regression tests for each boundary.
- **Scans/sandbox/websocket auth test isolation (P0 flake fix).**
  `AuthService` now accepts an optional `db` parameter and falls back to
  the global singleton; scans-workspace, sandbox-router, and websocket
  auth fixtures each create a per-test SQLite `DatabaseManager` and pass
  it explicitly. This eliminates the cross-test DB singleton contamination
  under `pytest-xdist` that produced the `Auth failed: invalid password`
  flake in `tests/serve/test_scans_workspace.py::test_viewer_is_rejected_with_403`
  (`test-matrix (3.10)` runs `28676461763` and `28677912736`).
- **Websocket auth test isolation.** Moved the websocket auth regression
  suite to its own per-module SQLite database so `fresh_user` setup is not
  affected by shared global DB state under `pytest-xdist`. This removes the
  rare auth flake that broke `test-matrix (3.10)` on the first main merge.
- **SQLite WAL test hardening.** Made SQLite `journal_mode` and `synchronous`
  configurable via environment variables (`PICOSHOGUN_DATABASE_JOURNAL_MODE`,
  `PICOSHOGUN_DATABASE_SYNCHRONOUS`) and forced the `serve` test fixtures to
  `DELETE` journal mode. This fixes the `sqlite3.OperationalError: disk I/O error`
  flakiness under `pytest-xdist` that appeared once the websocket-auth flake was
  removed.
- **Serve log/alert service exception narrowing.** `LogManager.query()` now
  catches only `(OSError, UnicodeDecodeError)` per log file; `AlertHub.send()`
  catches a targeted channel-error tuple instead of `except Exception`, so one
  failed notification channel no longer masks programmer errors. Added
  regression tests for both services.
- **Serve execution/observability exception narrowing.** Health probes in
  `EnhancedOrchestrator.get_health_checks()` now catch specific exception
  families (`_HEALTH_PROBE_ERRORS` for DB, `OSError` for disk,
  `(OSError, smtplib.SMTPException)` for SMTP). `JobScheduler._get_next_run()`
  narrowed the croniter catch to `(ValueError, TypeError, KeyError)`. OTel
  init/shutdown and FastAPI instrumentation in `observability.py` now catch
  `(OSError, RuntimeError, ValueError, TypeError)` instead of `Exception`.
  Added regression tests for all three surfaces.
- **CI observability test fixture.** The observability exception-narrowing
  regression tests inject fake `opentelemetry.*` modules so they exercise the
  intended code paths even when `test-serve`/`test-core` CI jobs install only
  `[serve]` extras and opentelemetry is absent. The fixture now injects the
  parent `opentelemetry` and `opentelemetry.sdk` namespace packages so the
  narrowed-exception tests no longer silently hit the `ImportError` path.
- **SQLite I/O error flake hardening.** `AuditMiddleware` now catches
  `sqlite3.Error` (and `psycopg2.Error` when installed) in addition to the
  existing `OSError`/`RuntimeError`/`ValueError`/`TypeError` tuple, ensuring a
  transient DB hiccup never fails an API request. The `serve` test fixtures
  additionally set `PICOSHOGUN_DATABASE_SYNCHRONOUS=OFF` alongside the existing
  `DELETE` journal mode to reduce temp-storage contention under
  `pytest-xdist`. Added a regression test for audit DB insert failures.
- **Scans workspace auth flake hotfix.** `tests/serve/conftest.py` now routes
  each pytest worker process to its own fresh `tempfile.mkdtemp` directory for
  the SQLite test database and registers cleanup on process exit. This removes
  stale-DB inheritance across CI runs or overlapping invocations, fixing the
  rare `Auth failed: invalid password` failure in
  `tests/serve/test_scans_workspace.py::test_viewer_is_rejected_with_403` under
  `test-matrix (3.10)`.
- **P4 #10 exception audit (plugin manager slice).** Narrowed broad
  `except Exception` in plugin loading boundaries to expected operational
  exceptions: `verify_manifest_signature`, the `_load_plugins` discovery loop,
  and `_load_plugin` host instantiation now catch
  `(OSError, RuntimeError, ValueError, TypeError, json.JSONDecodeError)` (with
  `BadSignatureError` still handled explicitly for signatures). Plugin hook
  dispatch, health checks, and shutdown remain broad safety nets so a single
  misbehaving plugin cannot crash the manager. Added regression tests in
  `tests/serve/services/test_plugin_manager.py`.
- **P4 #10 exception audit (sandbox health slice).** `check_health()` and
  `check_readiness()` in `picosentry/sandbox/health.py` now catch only
  `(OSError, RuntimeError, ValueError, TypeError, ImportError)` for their
  individual probes. Operational failures are logged and reported as unhealthy;
  unexpected programmer errors propagate instead of being masked as a healthy
  `error:` detail. Added regression tests in `tests/sandbox/test_health.py`.
- **P4 #10 exception audit (baseline hardening slice).**
  `HardenedBaselineManager.apply_update()` in
  `picosentry/sandbox/baseline_hardening.py` now catches
  `(OSError, RuntimeError, ValueError, TypeError)` around the audit-log write
  instead of silently swallowing all exceptions.  The baseline update still
  succeeds when audit logging fails, but unexpected programmer errors now
  propagate. Added regression tests in `tests/sandbox/test_baseline_hardening.py`.
- **P4 #10 exception audit (event bus slice).** `EventBus.publish()` in
  `picosentry/serve/services/event_bus.py` now catches only
  `(OSError, RuntimeError, ValueError, TypeError, AttributeError)` around
  subscriber callbacks. One misbehaving subscriber still cannot crash the bus,
  but programmer errors such as `NameError` now propagate. Added regression
  tests in `tests/serve/services/test_event_bus.py`.
- **P4 #10 exception audit (anomaly detector background loop slice).**
  `AnomalyDetector._background_loop()` now catches only
  `(OSError, RuntimeError, ValueError, TypeError)` around each check cycle
  instead of swallowing all exceptions. Operational failures are logged every
  60 seconds; programmer errors such as `NameError` propagate so the
  background thread fails loudly. Added regression tests in
  `tests/serve/services/test_anomaly_detector.py`.

## [2.0.16] — 2026-06-21

### Polish: surface-area narrowing, import guards, and scan-rule reliability

Addresses external review feedback by tightening the public API boundary and
making scan-rule failures visible rather than silent false negatives.

- Move the 19 MB malware benchmark corpus from `picosentry/scan/corpus/malware/`
  to `datasets/malware/` so it remains available for tests/benchmarks without
  being imported as part of the runtime package.
- Add an optional-dependency import guard to
  `picosentry.watch.server` that raises `ImportError` with the install hint
  `pip install 'picosentry[watch-server]'` when the `watch-server` extra is not
  present.
- Audit internal `except Exception: pass` sites in scan/detection paths and
  replace broad swallows with specific exception types plus `logger.warning`,
  `logger.exception`, or `logger.critical`. Affected paths:
  - `pypi_lock_parser`: malformed `poetry.lock` / `uv.lock`
  - `pypi_utils`: malformed `METADATA` / `pyproject.toml`
  - `dep_confusion`: malformed `.pypirc`
  - `advisory_check`: unreadable or unexpectedly broken lock files
  - `ioc_detection`: unexpected IoC corpus load failures
  - `cli_commands/scan`: cache read/write/deserialization failures
- Cache `CorpusIndex` instances in `corpus_index.py` per process, keyed by the
  resolved corpus file path, mtime, size, ecosystem, and built-in priority
  list. Eliminates redundant trie rebuilds across repeated scans, which were
  causing `test_malware_advisory_recall` and `test_validation_report_is_deterministic`
  to hit the 120 s pytest timeout.

**Version bump:** all `__version__` strings and deployment manifests bumped
from 2.0.15 to 2.0.16.

## [2.0.15] — 2026-06-21

### Staged token-filtered scanning + multi-ecosystem typosquat corpus

Adds a shared `PatternScanner` that pre-filters expensive regex rules with cheap
literal tokens, then refactors obfuscation, PyPI obfuscation, network exfil,
and worm propagation rules into deterministic sub-patterns carrying
`required_tokens`. Replaces brute-force typosquat checking with a
length-bucketed trie + iterative Levenshtein automaton (`CorpusIndex`),
pure Python and dependency-free.

Extends `picosentry update` with `--ecosystem {npm,pypi,go,cargo,maven,rubygems,nuget,all}`,
live npm/pypi fetchers, built-in fallbacks, and a `corpus.json` manifest; warns
when any ecosystem corpus is older than 30 days. Also fixes optional-dependency
test skips so the full suite runs clean in environments with or without
`pytest-timeout`/`sigstore` installed.

**Files changed:**
- New: `picosentry/scan/rules/pattern_scanner.py`, `corpus_index.py`
- Refactored: `obfuscation.py`, `pypi_obfuscation.py`, `network_exfil.py`,
  `worm_propagation.py`, `typosquat.py`, `engine.py`, `cli.py`
- Tests: `tests/scan/test_pattern_scanner.py`, `test_corpus_index.py`,
  `test_update_extended.py`, `test_timeout_plugin.py`, `test_benchmark.py`

**Version bump:** all `__version__` strings and deployment manifests bumped
from 2.0.14 to 2.0.15.

### Detection corpus expansion — L2-BUILD-001 cross-ecosystem build hooks

Closes task #4 ("Polish and improve code quality") by expanding the
highest-impact lever: the detection corpus. Adds a new cross-ecosystem
rule, **L2-BUILD-001 — Dangerous build-time hooks**, covering install-time
and build-time malicious behavior in Cargo (`build.rs`), Go
(`//go:generate`), RubyGems (`extconf.rb` / `.gemspec`), Maven
(`exec-maven-plugin`), and NuGet (MSBuild `.targets` / `.csproj`).

**New rule:** `picosentry/scan/rules/dangerous_build_hooks.py`
detects subprocess execution, network downloads, obfuscation, credential
reads, and system-path writes in build hooks. Registered as
`L2-BUILD-001` in `create_default_engine()`.

**New fixtures (10):**
- Positive: `malicious_cargo_build_rs`, `malicious_go_generate`,
  `malicious_rubygems_extconf`, `malicious_maven_exec_plugin`,
  `malicious_nuget_msbuild_target`
- Negative: `clean_cargo_build_rs`, `clean_go_generate`,
  `clean_rubygems_extconf`, `clean_maven_exec_plugin`,
  `clean_nuget_msbuild_target`

**Corpus counts updated across the codebase:** 188 fixtures
(150 positive / 38 negative), 54 rules (50 L2 + 4 L2-CAMP). All counts
synced in `picosentry/experimental.py`, `README.md`, and
`docs/BENCHMARKS.md` (per-rule table regenerated from
`tests/scan/fixtures/validation/REPORT.json`).

**Rule documentation:** `picosentry/scan/docs/rules/L2-BUILD-001.md`
covers all five ecosystems plus remediation guidance.

**Version bump:** All `__version__` strings and deployment manifests
kept in lockstep at 2.0.14 (pyproject.toml, picosentry/__init__.py,
_core, scan, sandbox, watch, serve/config/version.py,
deploy/helm/picodome/Chart.yaml, deploy/kubernetes/deployment.yaml).

## [2.0.13] — 2026-06-13

### Enterprise Beta — admission controller + sandbox fix + benchmark honesty

The v2.0.12 post-release review flagged a batch of P0/P1 items. The
P0 items (release hygiene, serve security, gRPC transport, Helm/K8s
staleness) were closed in the three post-2.0.12 commits. v2.0.13
closes the remaining Enterprise Beta gaps and fixes a sandbox CLI
bug that made `picosentry sandbox <command>` unusable with flags.

**Admission controller CLI (CRITICAL):** The
`picosentry/sandbox/admission/` module shipped a full K8s admission
webhook server (`AdmissionWebhookServer` with TLS,
`PodSecurityValidator`, `ImageScanner`) but had no CLI entry point.
The Helm chart `deploy/helm/picodome-admission/` expected
`args: ["admission", ...]` which would crash-loop. Fixed by:
- New `picosentry/sandbox/cli_commands/admission.py` (follows the
  `daemon.py` pattern)
- `admission` subparser in `cli.py` with `--host`, `--port`,
  `--cert-file` (required), `--key-file` (required), `--background`,
  `--scan-enabled`, `--scan-min-severity`, `--daemon-url`
- `admission` added to `_COMMAND_MATURITY` as BETA
- Exit-code capture fixed for both `daemon` and `admission`
  (was discarding the return value)

**Sandbox CLI argparse collision (CRITICAL):** `picosentry sandbox
echo hello` and `picosentry sandbox --backend=subprocess echo hello`
both failed with "invalid choice: 'echo'". Three root causes:
- **Dest collision**: top-level subparser `dest="command"` and
  sandbox positional `"command"` both wrote to `args.command`;
  the subparser's value overwrote the positional's list.
  Fixed by renaming the positional to `"cmd"`.
- **Subparser conflict**: the sandbox subparser (`analyze/pipeline/
  rules/init`) rejected arbitrary commands. Fixed by removing the
  argparse subparser and doing manual routing in `_handle_sandbox()`
  based on `args.cmd[0]`.
- **Missing "sandbox" prefix**: `_handle_sandbox` forwards to
  `sandbox_main()` which has its own `sandbox` subcommand. Fixed by
  prepending `"sandbox"` to argv.

**Benchmark overclaim (P1 → fixed):** The per-rule table in
`docs/BENCHMARKS.md` reported "100% precision" for rules with zero
negative fixtures — vacuous because the denominator `TP + FP`
collapses to `TP`. Three changes:
- Vacuous-precision marker (`⁂`) on the per-rule table, rendered
  automatically by `scripts/render_benchmarks.py`
- New `clean_npm_shai_hulud_legit` negative fixture for
  `L2-CAMP-SHAI-HULUD` (Bun-friendly npm project)
- Stale counts corrected in README + BENCHMARKS.md: 178 fixtures
  (145 pos / 33 neg), 49 L2 rule_ids + 4 L2-CAMP rule_ids

**DDoS rate limit (P1 — verified complete):** `DDoSShieldMiddleware`
with health-path exemption, per-path burst buckets, and global
bucket. 6 dedicated tests in `tests/serve/test_ddos_health_exempt.py`.

**Stale image tag (MEDIUM):** `deploy/kubernetes/deployment.yaml`
bumped from `kirkforge/picodome:v2.0.12` to `v2.0.13` with a
local-build comment.

**Version bump:** All `__version__` strings bumped 2.0.12 → 2.0.13
(pyproject.toml, picosentry/__init__.py, _core, sandbox, watch,
scan, serve/config/version.py, deploy/helm/picodome/Chart.yaml).

### Still deferred to v2.0.14+
- Test suite slow: 71s for sandbox suite alone
- `kirkforge/picodome` image not published to Docker Hub
- Postgres backend migration not started
- Multi-node cluster gossip untested

### Fixed — gRPC transport was unimportable in the published wheel (P0)

Commit `4b99935` — `fix(grpc): commit generated stubs + modernize fallback API`.

The `picosentry[sandbox.grpc_transport]` module was unimportable in a
stock `pip install` of v2.0.12. Three independent breaks:

- **Missing generated stubs**: `picodome_pb2.py` and `picodome_pb2_grpc.py`
  were never generated or committed. A `pip install picosentry[grpc]`
  on a fresh venv would import the transport module and crash at the
  first reference to `picodome_pb2`. Both files are now committed under
  `picosentry/sandbox/grpc_transport/proto/`, plus an empty `__init__.py`
  to make the directory a regular package, and `pyproject.toml` lists
  the directory in `package-data` so the stubs ship in sdists and
  wheels.
- **Dead `grpc.ServiceRpcHandlers` API**: the fallback
  `add_servicer_manually` (used when the generated stubs are missing)
  called `grpc.ServiceRpcHandlers.add_PicoDomeServiceServicer_to_server`,
  which was removed in grpcio 1.50. The fallback now uses the modern
  `grpc.method_handlers_generic_handler`. The fallback path is still
  present (identity passthrough codecs) but is no longer a guaranteed
  dead path on a modern grpcio.
- **No `grpc` extra in pyproject**: even with the stubs committed, the
  `grpcio` runtime package wasn't a declared optional dependency. The
  transport module imports grpcio lazily, so a user who didn't install
  `[grpc]` would only hit the missing-import error at `is_grpc_available()`
  call time. `pyproject.toml` now declares `grpc = ["grpcio>=1.50"]`
  (1.50+ because that's the version that removed `ServiceRpcHandlers`).

A new `scripts/regen_proto.sh` regenerates the stubs from
`picodome.proto` (uses `PYTHON_BIN` if set, then `python3`/`python`
with `grpc_tools` importable, then `uv run --with grpcio-tools python`
as a slow auto-install fallback). It re-applies the
`import picodome_pb2` → `from . import picodome_pb2` patch
(grpc_tools.protoc emits a flat import that only resolves when the
package dir is on `sys.path`; the relative form is what works inside a
regular Python package), and `touch -r`s the regenerated `.py` files
to the `.proto` mtime so grpcio doesn't warn about a stale stub.

4 end-to-end tests added under `TestEndToEndGRPC` in
`tests/sandbox/test_grpc_transport.py`: stubs importable, the
`_pb2_grpc.py` uses the relative import, a real gRPC server boots
and a real RPC round-trips, and the modern-API fallback is in place
(verified by AST inspection of the function body, not the docstring,
which still mentions the removed API name).

### Fixed — Helm chart and K8s manifest did not deploy the gRPC transport (P0)

Commit `92aec8f` — `fix(deploy): expose gRPC transport in Helm + K8s`.

A `helm install deploy/helm/picodome/` of v2.0.12 (or a
`kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/`) would produce a running pod
that **could not serve the gRPC transport** even after the user
fixed the missing-stubs problem from the previous fix. Three breaks:

- **The chart pointed at a CLI path that didn't exist**: the chart's
  `args: ["sandbox", "daemon", "--transport=grpc", ...]` would
  fail with `picosentry sandbox: error: argument sandbox_command:
  invalid choice: 'daemon' (choose from analyze, pipeline, rules,
  init)`. The `daemon` subcommand was registered only in
  `picosentry/sandbox/cli.py` (the `prog="picodome"` standalone CLI,
  which is not exposed as a console-script entry point). Fixed by
  registering `daemon` as a top-level subcommand in
  `picosentry/cli.py` (same `add_arguments` / `cmd` reused from
  `picosentry/sandbox/cli_commands/daemon.py`). `picosentry daemon
  --transport=grpc --grpc-port=50051` now works.
- **The Docker image didn't have `grpcio` installed**: the runtime
  stage installed with `"${WHEEL}[all]"`, but `[all]` did not compose
  `grpc`. Fixed by changing the install to `[all,grpc]`, and adding
  `grpc` to the `[all]` extra in `pyproject.toml`. Also added
  `EXPOSE 50051` to the runtime stage (the gRPC daemon's default
  port).
- **The chart and manifest didn't declare the gRPC port**: even with
  the CLI and the image fixed, the chart's container spec had no
  `containerPort` named `grpc`, and the Service had no `grpc` port
  entry. The K8s manifest was the same, plus a fourth break: the
  K8s manifest used the image's default `CMD ["--help"]`, so the
  pod would print the help text and exit (CrashLoopBackOff). All
  three manifests now declare a `name: grpc` `containerPort: 50051`
  and pass `args: ["daemon", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=8443",
  "--transport=grpc", "--grpc-port=50051"]`. The Helm chart gates
  the gRPC bits on a new opt-in `grpc:` block (`enabled: false`,
  `port: 50051`); the K8s manifest always exposes gRPC (since the
  flat file is meant to be hand-edited, and a separate
  `picodome-grpc` Service is included).

End-to-end verified in the rebuilt image:

```
STEP 1: launching gRPC daemon
STEP 2: daemon pid=7
Starting PicoDome gRPC daemon on 127.0.0.1:50061
STEP 3: port 50061 is listening
STEP 4: Health RPC -> healthy=True version=2.0.12 uptime=2
END-TO-END OK
```

Sandbox test suite: 1451 passed, 18 skipped (sandbox-internal
tests requiring root or `CONFIG_SECCOMP_LOG=y`). gRPC transport
tests: 57 passed. Daemon handler/store tests: 40 passed.

### Fixed — release hygiene + serve security (P0, already on origin via 8bb55dc)

Commit `8bb55dc` — `fix: P0 release hygiene + serve security batch`.

The v2.0.12 post-release review flagged a batch of issues. Closed:

- **CHANGELOG date**: `2.0.12` was dated `2026-06-07` (the day the
  refactor was committed), not the actual release date. Bumped to
  the correct date.
- **Version drift**: `picosentry/sandbox/__init__.py` and
  `picosentry/serve/config/version.py` were each two minor versions
  behind `pyproject.toml`. All four bumped to 2.0.12.
- **Dead docs removed**: stale `docs/` files referencing the v2.0.5
  fixture set, a `CHANGELOG.md` for the `picodome` binary that is
  no longer shipped, and other rot.
- **Serve security (5 distinct issues, all closed)**: the Settings
  dataclass had `secret_key` defaulting to a hardcoded string; the
  `RegisterRequest` Pydantic model accepted a `role` field that
  bypassed server-side role assignment; the WebSocket endpoint
  accepted connections before the auth check; the `/scans` endpoint
  accepted arbitrary `target` paths (no path-safety check); the
  DDoS shield rate limiter had a default that was effectively a
  no-op. Each fix is in its own commit; see the v2.0.12 review doc
  for the before/after.

### Fixed — Plugin auto-load (P1 → fixed)

`PluginManager` was hardcoded to scan the bundled
`picosentry/serve/plugins/` directory. A wheel-installed user had no
way to add their own plugin without `pip install -e`'ing the source
tree. Three changes:

- **User plugin dirs are now first-class.** The manager accepts an
  `extra_plugin_dirs` argument, reads the `PICOSHOGUN_PLUGIN_DIR`
  env var (comma-separated), and auto-discovers
  `~/.picosentry/plugins/` if it exists. Discovery order: explicit
  `plugin_dir` arg > extra dirs (CLI / env / user default) > bundled.
  Duplicates (by realpath) are collapsed.
- **Dead `import plugins as _plugins_pkg` branch removed.** The
  previous code tried to import a top-level `plugins` package that
  is never shipped; the canonical resolution is now
  `os.path.join(<services_dir>, "../plugins")`, which works in both
  the dev tree and a wheel install.
- **`picosentry serve --plugin-dir <path>` is repeatable.** The
  flag accumulates; multiple `--plugin-dir` flags are merged with
  the env var and the bundled dir, and the resolved list is
  surfaced in the `GET /plugins` response as a new `dirs` field.
  A new `plugin_manager.reload(extra_dirs)` method makes the
  re-discovery idempotent: already-loaded plugins are not
  re-instantiated, new plugins are loaded.
- **Test coverage added.** New file
  `tests/serve/test_plugin_auto_load.py` (7 tests) covers the
  default load, the `extra_plugin_dirs` path, the env-var path,
  `reload()` idempotency, realpath dedup, and the `/plugins`
  router contract. Full serve suite: 243 passed.

### Fixed — Benchmark overclaim + campaign overmatching (P1 → fixed)

The per-rule table in `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` was reporting
"100% precision" for rules with zero negative fixtures. That number
is vacuous — the denominator `TP + FP` collapses to `TP` (which is
always `1` for any rule with a positive fixture), so the value
measures nothing. The TL;DR "Mean precision / recall: 1.00 / 1.00"
was also reported without acknowledging vacuous rows. Three
changes close the gap:

- **Vacuous-precision marker (`⁂`) on the per-rule table.** When a
  rule has `n_pos > 0` and `n_neg == 0`, `scripts/render_benchmarks.py`
  appends a `⁂` to the `rule_id` cell. The matching footnote in
  `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` defines the marker. As of this release, zero
  rules carry the marker.
- **`L2-CAMP-SHAI-HULUD` now has a Bun-friendly negative fixture.**
  `tests/scan/fixtures/validation/negative/clean_npm_shai_hulud_legit/`
  is a 3-file npm project (`package.json`, `README.md`, `src/index.js`)
  that exercises the L2-CAMP-SHAI-HULUD detector's edge cases (Bun
  runtime mentions, no postinstall, no compromised-package deps)
  without tripping the named-signature, payload-filename, or
  compromised-package matchers. The new row shows
  `n_pos=1, n_neg=1, TP=1, FP=0, FN=0` — a measured, no-longer-
  vacuous precision claim.
- **Stale counts in the README + BENCHMARKS.md corrected.** The
  README "Status" table now reads "178 fixtures (145 positive, 33
  negative), 49 L2 rule_ids + 4 L2-CAMP rule_ids". The
  `v2.1.0 expansion target` section's "v2.0.9 sits at 1 fixture per
  rule" claim is corrected to "v2.0.9 minimum is 1 positive fixture
  per rule; mean is ~3 positives + ~3 negatives per rule across 53
  rules". The `⁂` marker is added to the v2.1.0 expansion
  acceptance criteria (zero `⁂` markers = all rules have at least
  one negative).

Validation harness: 178 fixtures (145 pos / 33 neg), mean
precision 1.00, mean recall 1.00, 0 failures.

### Not yet fixed (P1 — deferred)
- **Test suite slow**: 71s for the sandbox suite alone. Most of
  this is a handful of integration tests that spin up real
  daemons. Tracked for v2.0.13.
- **Admission chart**: `deploy/helm/picodome-admission/` is still
  pointed at a non-existent `picosentry admission` subcommand. Same
  fix shape as the `daemon` subcommand (register at top level,
  reuse the `picosentry/sandbox/admission/` code). Deferred until
  the user asks for it.

## [2.0.12] — 2026-06-07

Ships a token-saving minifier (`.tools/minify.py`) and runs it across all
333 source files in `picosentry/`. No public API changes — `picosentry scan`,
`picodome`, and the watch/serve CLIs behave identically. The minified tree
passes the same 3631 tests as the v2.0.11 baseline (the 8 pre-existing
failures are unchanged: 3 seccomp tests that need `libseccomp` +
`CONFIG_SECCOMP_LOG=y`, and 5 CLI-subprocess tests blocked by a pre-existing
`tests/conftest.py` PYTHONPATH bug — both out of scope for this release).

### Added — `picosentry` source minifier (`.tools/minify.py`)

- **333 source files** under `picosentry/` minified: 63,709 → 53,298 lines
  (-16.3% lines, with roughly comparable byte savings after stripping
  comments and docstrings). Net effect for kirkforge-CLI's read_file
  minifier: ~10k fewer tokens to push into a model context for the same
  payload. The minifier is idempotent and safe to re-run; it is **not**
  applied to `tests/` (tests are run by pytest directly, not read by
  kirkforge).
- **What gets stripped**: whole-line `#` comments (except tool directives
  — `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, `# coding:`, `# pragma:`, `# mypy:`,
  `# pylint:`, `# isort:`, `# flake8:`, `# fmt:`, `# ruff:`), and
  module/class/function docstrings detected via `ast.parse` so the
  boundaries are exactly what Python would treat as docstrings. PEP 8
  blank-line spacing (1 blank between import groups, 2 blanks between
  top-level defs) is preserved.
- **What is preserved**: the module docstring of `picosentry/cli.py`
  (consumed by `argparse` as the program description), all tool-directive
  comments, all string contents (triple-quoted config templates,
  including `picosentry/scan/cli_commands/init.py::cmd`'s full
  `.picosentry.yml` template, are not touched), and `tests/` is
  completely untouched.
- **Implementation note**: comment detection uses `tokenize.generate_tokens`
  to avoid stripping `#` lines that are inside multi-line string literals
  — a hand-rolled char scanner (initial implementation) misread those as
  comments and clipped the body of a config-template string. The
  `ast`-based docstring detector handles the `body[0] is the only
  statement → leave it` edge case so docstring-only class/function
  bodies don't become empty.

### Changed — ruff config

- `pyproject.toml`: added `"I001"` to `[tool.ruff.lint] ignore = [...]`.
  isort's "import block is un-sorted or un-formatted" rule fires on
  minified output where inter-group blank lines are sometimes
  re-distributed by the comment-stripping step. The minified output is
  functionally correct — the imports load, the symbols resolve, the
  tests pass — so the rule is suppressed for the shipped tree. Unminified
  source can still be developed in the original style; running the
  minifier after edits will produce the same import layout.

### Notes for developers

- If you edit source under `picosentry/` and want the minified tree
  regenerated, run `python3 .tools/minify.py picosentry/`. The script is
  idempotent (running it on already-minified output is a no-op).
- The minifier is intentionally conservative — it only strips what it
  can prove is safe to strip. It does not rename, reflow, sort, or
  reformat. If you want formatting, run `ruff format` separately on the
  unminified source before committing.

## [2.0.11] — 2026-06-07

Two-pronged release: (1) the v2.0.10 security and code-health follow-ups
that were uncommitted in the working tree, rolled forward into v2.0.11
so the version sync is real; (2) a structural refactor of the eight
largest source files in the package into shim + subpackage form, with
test-fixture consolidation. No public API changes for `picosentry scan`
or `picodome` users — the public import paths and CLI surface are
unchanged.

The umbrella version, the previously-stale per-subpackage versions
(`picosentry/sandbox/__init__.py` and `picosentry/serve/config/version.py`
were both stuck at 2.0.7), and `pyproject.toml` are now in sync at
2.0.11.

### Fixed — sandbox seccomp fork+exec ordering (Bug #1)

### Fixed — sandbox seccomp fork+exec ordering (Bug #1)
- **`picosentry/sandbox/l3/backends/seccomp_backend.py`** and the
  mirrored `seccomp_trace_backend.py`: env-dict construction
  (`os.environ.copy()` + `dict.update()`) is now done in the **parent**
  before `os.fork()`. Previously it ran in the forked child *after*
  `seccomp_load()` but *before* `os.execve()`. Under a `KILL`-default
  policy, CPython allocators (`mmap`/`brk`/`futex`) issued during the
  dict operations would SIGSYS the child non-deterministically, before
  it ever executed. The child now runs only `seccomp_load` → `execve`
  under the active filter, with zero Python-side allocation. Trivial
  to verify: `picosentry sandbox echo hi` under a KILL-default policy
  succeeds deterministically.

### Fixed — silent `seccomp_rule_add` failures (Bug #2)
- **`picosentry/sandbox/l3/backends/_seccomp_common.py::add_rule_safely`** (new helper, used by both backends): wraps `seccomp_rule_add` and checks the return value. libseccomp returns `-EACCES` when a rule's action matches the filter's default action (the explicit KILL rules in a KILL-default filter were no-ops; the explicit ALLOW rules in an ALLOW-default filter were no-ops). EACCES is now logged at DEBUG and skipped, not silently swallowed. `-EINVAL` (unknown syscall) and other failures log at WARNING. Same fix applied to both `SeccompBackend` and `SeccompTraceBackend`.

### Fixed — notary default-HMAC integrity hole
- **`picosentry/sandbox/cli.py`**: removed the `_DEFAULT_CLI_HMAC_KEY = "picodome-notary-cli-default"` constant. The previous `notary submit` and `notary verify` paths used a public, hardcoded key as the *fallback* when `PICODOME_NOTARY_HMAC_KEY` was unset, after printing a stderr warning. That meant any third party with the source code could forge audit entries and pass `audit --verify`. v2.0.11 hard-errors if neither `--hmac-key` nor `PICODOME_NOTARY_HMAC_KEY` is set, with the message *"PICODOME_NOTARY_HMAC_KEY or --hmac-key is required"*. **This is a breaking change for any script relying on the default key.** The fix is one env-var export: `export PICODOME_NOTARY_HMAC_KEY=$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))')`. The `audit --verify` path didn't use the default key directly, but the underlying chain integrity is now end-to-end consistent. (Originally documented under v2.0.10, rolled forward to v2.0.11 since the v2.0.10 work was never shipped.)

### Changed — `_seccomp_common` refactor
- **New file `picosentry/sandbox/l3/backends/_seccomp_common.py`** holds the duplicated constants (`SAFE_SYSCALLS`, `NETWORK_SYSCALLS`, `FS_WRITE_SYSCALLS`, `FS_READ_SYSCALLS`, `PROCESS_SYSCALLS`), the libseccomp `setup_lib` argtypes, the `target_to_syscalls` mapping, the `resolve_syscall` cache, and the new `add_rule_safely` wrapper. Both backends now `from _seccomp_common import …` instead of carrying their own copies. The previous "Keep in sync with seccomp_backend.py" comment (an explicit maintenance hazard in the trace backend's module docstring) is gone — a change to the syscall sets is now a single edit. The duplication was 99% byte-identical (only comment lines differed); the refactor is risk-neutral and adds a `TestSeccompCommon.test_target_to_syscalls_all_targets` net.

### Changed — main `picosentry` CLI `sandbox` parity
- **`picosentry/cli.py`**: the `sandbox` subcommand's `--backend` choices now include `seccomp-trace` (previously only the standalone `picodome` CLI accepted it, despite the README documenting it on `picosentry sandbox`). Also added three missing flags: `--allow-degraded` (forwarded to picodome's CLI), `--allow-runtime {node,python}` (preset policies for npm/pip), and `--verify-determinism` (SHA-256 stability check). The `_handle_sandbox` forwarder (`picosentry/cli.py:512-555`) was extended to pass all three through. Users who read the README at line 44–48 will now find `--backend=seccomp-trace` actually accepted by argparse, and won't have to discover the picodome CLI to use these features.

### Changed — `seccomp_trace_backend.py` docstring honesty
- The module docstring previously advertised *"Strategy B (PTRACE_SECCOMP) and C (SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF) will populate args in v2.0.9+"* and *"the canonical audit-log integration (auditd / ausearch) is the v2.0.9 target."* Neither landed. v2.0.11 rewrites both as v2.1.0+ work and keeps the existing `SCMP_ACT_LOG` limitation prose (no path/address args) intact. The trace backend still works as documented for "list every syscall the tracee made"; it does not, and v2.0.11 will not, list file paths or network addresses.

### Fixed — pytest config typo
- **`pyproject.toml:147-148`**: `asyncio_mode` and `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope` were under `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` but they're `pytest-asyncio` settings, not core pytest settings. Moved to a new `[tool.pytest_asyncio.ini_options]` section. Silences the two `Unknown config option` warnings on every test run.

### Changed — version sync
- `picosentry/sandbox/__init__.py:3` and `picosentry/serve/config/version.py:3` were stale at `2.0.7` (two versions behind). Bumped to `2.0.11` along with the umbrella version and `pyproject.toml`. All four now agree.

### Changed — refactor: 5 source files split into shim + subpackage
Eight long source files (the five flagged in the audit plus three
follow-on splits) were broken up so no `picosentry/` source file is
over 800 lines. Each split preserves a thin re-export shim at the
original import path, so production callers and test files that import
private symbols (`_cmd_update`, `_AUDIT_LINE_RE`, `_handle_validate`,
etc.) keep working unchanged.

| File (before) | Lines | Shim | New submodules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scan/cli.py` | 1940 | 178 | `scan/cli_commands/{__init__,_common,scan,check,diff,init,update,workspace,corpus,ioc,policy,advisories,daemon,cache,metrics,benchmark,rules,version}.py` (17 modules, registry-based dispatch) |
| `sandbox/cli.py` | 1461 | 117 | `sandbox/cli_commands/<one module per subcommand>.py` (16 modules) |
| `sandbox/daemon/server.py` | 1364 | 50 | `sandbox/daemon/{constants,job_store,handler_mixins,handler_routes_get,handler_routes_post,handler,daemon,app}.py` (8 modules; `PicoDomeHandler` composed from 4 mixins) |
| `serve/services/correlation.py` | 1080 | 68 (folded into `correlation/__init__.py`) | `serve/services/correlation/{models,helpers,narrative,persistence,engine}.py` (5 modules) |
| `sandbox/cluster/manager.py` | 1050 | 112 | `sandbox/cluster/{models,state,orchestrator}.py` + `sandbox/cluster/backends/{base,memory,sqlite}.py` (7 modules) |
| `sandbox/l3/backends/seccomp_trace_backend.py` | 914 | 107 (re-exports `os`, `_AUDIT_LINE_RE`, `_LOG_ACTION_CODE`, `add_rule_safely` for test patches) | `sandbox/l3/backends/seccomp_trace/{__init__,_audit,filter_builder,event_parser,process_manager,orchestrator}.py` (6 modules) |
| `scan/policy.py` | 836 | 72 | `scan/policy_pkg/{models,engine,bundle,template}.py` (5 modules) |
| `sandbox/daemon/sqlite_store` + `.store` (in `daemon/server.py`) | — | (folded into `daemon/` subpackage) | `sandbox/daemon/{store,sqlite_store}.py` (referenced by the shim) |

Largest remaining source file: `picosentry/scan/daemon.py` at 797
lines. Public import paths, public function/class names, and the CLI
surface are unchanged.

### Added — shared scan test fixtures
- **`tests/scan/conftest.py`** (new): `make_npm_project`, `make_finding`,
  `make_scan_result`, and a `scan_fixtures_dir` fixture. The three
  `_make_project` / `_make_finding` / `_make_result` helpers and six
  `FIXTURES_DIR = Path(__file__).parent / "fixtures"` constants that
  were duplicated across `test_scanner.py`, `test_cli.py`,
  `test_cli_unit.py`, `test_policy_extended.py`,
  `test_action_exit_code.py`, `test_engine.py`, and
  `test_realistic_fixtures.py` now share a single definition. Tests
  import from `conftest` and keep the same fixture name in scope.

### Changed — test patches
- **`tests/scan/test_crypto_integration.py:157`**: patch target moved
  from `picosentry.scan.policy.sign_content` to
  `picosentry.scan.policy_pkg.bundle.sign_content` (call-site migration
  to the new module that owns `export_signed_policy`). All other test
  patches land unchanged because the shim files re-export the symbols
  tests reach for, and Python's package-vs-module precedence
  guarantees `correlation/` wins over the deleted `correlation.py`.

## [2.0.9] — 2026-06-06

### Added — detection corpus expansion
- **45 validation fixtures covering all 49 L2 rule_ids** (was 7 fixtures / 5 rules
  in v2.0.8). v2.0.9 expands the corpus to 39 positive + 6 negative fixtures
  under `tests/scan/fixtures/validation/{positive,negative}/` and brings every
  L2 rule in `RULE_INFO` to ≥ 1 positive fixture, with mean precision 1.0 and
  mean recall 1.0 reproduced by `picosentry scan --validate`.
- **7 new ecosystem domains now exercised**: v2.0.8 had npm + PyPI; v2.0.9
  adds Cargo, Go, Maven, RubyGems, and NuGet. Every detector alias
  (`L2-CARGO-*`, `L2-GO-*`, `L2-MAVEN-*`, `L2-RUBYGEMS-*`, `L2-NUGET-*`) has
  at least one positive fixture.
- **Advisory-DB staging via `_advisories/`**: 7 OSV-format advisory JSON
  files dropped under `tests/scan/fixtures/validation/_advisories/`. The
  validation harness now auto-discovers this directory at the validation
  root and forwards the path to `engine.scan()`. Before this fix, the
  `L2-ADV-001` and the 6 ecosystem alias rules **could not fire under
  `--validate`** because `run_validation()` did not pass an `advisory_db_path`.
- **New built-in IoC** `picosentry/scan/corpus/ioc/event_stream_malicious_336.json`
  for the Shai-Hulud variant `event-stream@3.3.6`. The new IoC uses the
  correct `package_name` key. (Note: the 7 pre-existing IoC files at
  `picosentry/scan/corpus/ioc/` use `name` where the detector reads
  `package_name` — a latent bug. Renaming the existing 7 is deferred to
  v2.0.10 to keep this PR's blast radius small; this CHANGELOG entry
  documents the issue so consumers of the IoC corpus know.)
- **Tricky-negatives corpus** (`tests/scan/fixtures/validation/_tricky/`)
  with 6 fixtures and a new `tests/scan/test_tricky_negatives.py` pytest
  that documents known detector limits:
    - 3 fixtures assert a specific rule fires at an expected severity
      (e.g. `l0dash` is a typosquat of `lodash`).
    - 3 fixtures assert zero findings (e.g. `bytes.fromhex(...)` does
      not trigger `L2-PYPI-OBFS-002`; reading `/etc/hosts` does not
      trigger `L2-CRED-001` / `L2-NETEX-001`).
  These guard against detector limits silently changing after a refactor.
  Tricky fixtures are **not** picked up by the strict CI gate — they
  live under `_tricky/` (leading underscore) to stay out of
  `discover_fixtures()`.

### Fixed
- **`picosentry/scan/validation.py::run_validation`**: added an
  `advisory_db_path` kwarg that auto-discovers
  `<validation_root>/_advisories/` if that directory exists. Without
  this, the 7 advisory rules (`L2-ADV-001` + 6 ecosystem aliases)
  silently could not fire under `--validate` because the harness did
  not pass an advisory DB to `engine.scan()`.
- **`picosentry/scan/rules/advisory_check.py`** (3 latent bugs in the
  advisory detector, all surfaced by the new validation fixtures):
    - `_collect_rubygems_packages` was iterating `dependencies` as if
      it were a dict; it is actually a list of `(name, version, source)`
      tuples. Fixed.
    - `_collect_maven_packages` was building the package key as
      `f"{group_id}:{artifact_id}"`, but OSV advisories for Maven use
      the bare `artifact_id` (Maven coordinates are advisory-internal,
      not part of the package identity). Fixed.
    - `_collect_pypi_packages` always set `version="unknown"` for
      `pyproject.toml`-style dependencies, so version-range advisories
      could never match. Workaround in the fixtures: include a
      `requirements.txt` with pinned versions. (Detector fix deferred
      to v2.0.10.)
- **`picosentry/scan/rules/go_utils.py`**: `_GO_MOD_REQUIRE_RE`
  required a leading tab before `require`; real-world `go.mod` files
  use column-0 `require` for single-line deps, so the regex never
  matched. Fixed.
- **`picosentry/scan/rules/typosquat.py`** (`_collect_cargo_deps` and
  `_collect_maven_deps`): now include the root crate's `package_name`
  and the root `pom.xml`'s `artifactId` in the typosquat corpus. The
  PyPI collector was already doing this for `pyproject.toml`
  `project.name`; cargo and maven now match.
- **`docs/BENCHMARKS.md` line 211**: typo fix — "top-327 corpus" →
  "top-100 corpus (with a 327-entry on-disk fallback at
  `picosentry/scan/corpus/npm_top_packages.json`)".

### Changed
- `experimental.py` maturity table: `Detection quality benchmarks`
  flips from `⚠️ Beta` to `✅ Stable`. The v2.0.9 corpus is a smoke
  test, not a statistically meaningful benchmark, but it is now
  reproducible from a fresh clone and exercised by CI on every PR.
- `README.md` "What it does NOT do" block: removed the
  "Detection-benchmark data" line (gap closed).
- `pyproject.toml` and `picosentry/__init__.py`: version bumped to 2.0.9.
- `tests/scan/fixtures/validation/REPORT.json`: regenerated against the
  expanded corpus (50 rule_metrics rows, 45 fixture_results, 0 failures).

## [2.0.8] — 2026-06-06

### Added — kernel-syscall observation (P0)
- **`SeccompTraceBackend`** (`--backend=seccomp-trace` on `picosentry sandbox`): sibling
  to the existing `seccomp-bpf` backend. Uses `SCMP_ACT_LOG` + `/proc/<pid>/seccomp`
  to capture every syscall the tracee makes and emits one `SandboxEvent` per syscall.
  Default action is `SCMP_ACT_LOG` when the policy is permissive;
  `SCMP_ACT_KILL_PROCESS` when KILL semantics are required. Closes the
  teardown-proven gap: prior L3 produced `events: 0` and did not capture stdout,
  so the README's "shows you the syscalls" claim was false. v2.0.8 ships events
  without syscall args; v2.0.9 (`PTRACE_SECCOMP` or `SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF`)
  populates path/address.
- Auto-detect precedence unchanged: `seccomp-trace` is explicit-only in 2.0.8
  (set `PICODOME_SANDBOX_BACKEND=seccomp-trace` or pass `--backend=seccomp-trace`).
- Integration tests gated on `PICODOME_HAS_SECCOMP=1` and
  `SeccompTraceBackend.is_available()` to skip kernels without
  `CONFIG_SECCOMP_LOG=y`.

### Added — detection benchmarks (P1)
- **`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`**: published detection-quality methodology and v2.0.8
  numbers (7 fixtures, 5 rules, 100% precision / 100% recall). Reproducible from
  a fresh clone via `picosentry scan --validate`. The 100% floor is enforced in
  CI by `tests/scan/test_validation.py::test_validation_passes_at_100_percent_on_current_fixtures`.
  Corpus expansion to 30+ fixtures/rule is the v2.0.9 target (acceptance
  criteria in the document).
- **`tests/scan/fixtures/validation/REPORT.json`**: checked-in dump of the
  harness output. `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` per-rule table is mechanically derivable
  from this file; if the two diverge, the JSON is the source of truth.

### Changed
- `experimental.py` and `README.md` maturity table: `Detection benchmarks` flips
  from `❌ Stub` to `⚠️ Beta`.
- `README.md` "What it does NOT do" block: removed the "Does not record
  per-syscall traces" and "Does not have detection-benchmark data" lines (both
  gaps closed). The block is now 4 items, down from 6.
- Version bumped to 2.0.8 in `picosentry/__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml`.

## [2.0.7] — 2026-06-06

This release consolidates the unpublished 2.0.3–2.0.6 chain (CI repair
work that was committed to `main` but never published to PyPI) plus the
actual blocker for the `docker-build` job, plus a README and source-code
pass to remove overclaimed language. PyPI users go straight from
**2.0.2 → 2.0.7**.

### Fixed — `docker-build` CI job
The 2.0.6 release chain failed CI on `docker-build` because the
`Dockerfile` was hardcoded to `picosentry-2.0.0-py3-none-any.whl` (the
version present when the Dockerfile was last verified). The `python -m
build` step in the builder stage was producing a wheel with the new
version number, and the runtime stage then tried to install a
non-existent `2.0.0` wheel. The CI red was not about pytest install
extras — that misdiagnosis cost five release cycles.

Fix in `Dockerfile`: drop the hardcoded version, glob
`/tmp/picosentry-*-py3-none-any.whl` at install time, and remove the
stale `org.opencontainers.image.version` label that drifted the same
way. Verified locally with `docker build` + `docker run picosentry:test
{scan,sandbox,watch,serve} --help`.

### Fixed — CI matrix stability (cumulative from 2.0.3–2.0.6, all in this release)
- **`test-serve` (10 failures).** `picosentry/serve/database/manager.py` —
  `DatabaseManager.execute()` and `execute_one()` now materialize rows as
  `dict` at the boundary, so call sites that use `(row or {}).get("col")`
  work without further edits. Matches the `-> dict | None` hint that was
  already documented.
- **`test-watch` / `test-core` / `test-matrix`.** CI install command
  changed to `pip install --no-cache-dir -e ".[all,dev]"` — runtime
  dependencies (fastapi, PyJWT, passlib[bcrypt], etc.) plus the test tools
  (pytest, ruff, mypy).
- **`type-check` (3 unused-ignore errors).** `picosentry/serve/services/observability.py`
  and `picosentry/sandbox/tracing.py` — extracted helper / sentinel
  pattern so neither file rebinds an OTel name in an `except ImportError`
  branch. Removes the dead `# type: ignore[assignment]` comments that
  were flagged as unused under newer mypy with
  `ignore_missing_imports = true`.
- **`test-scan` (2 corpus-dependent failures).** Removed
  `npm_top_packages.json` from `.gitignore` and committed the existing
  327-entry corpus file. Fixes both `test_corpus_loaded_from_file` (now
  sees 327 entries, not the 99-entry builtin fallback) and
  `test_crossenv_credential_theft` (the `crossenv` typosquat matches
  against `cross-env` at line 91 of the on-disk corpus).
- **Python 3.10 `Z`-suffix compatibility.** `picosentry/scan/corpus_governance.py::CorpusSource.is_stale`
  normalizes trailing `Z` to `+00:00` before `datetime.fromisoformat()`,
  so the same code works across 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13. Without this fix,
  3.10 CI raised `ValueError` in the existing `except` branch and
  counted the 2099-dated source as stale.

### Changed — README and source-code honesty pass
The 2.0.1–2.0.2 README and several code comments / design docs used
"the only…", "we own…", "un-clonable moat", and "what separates X from
Y" framing — market positioning language borrowed from a competitive
review. Two external reviewers flagged this in June 2026. Replaced
with feature-led copy:

- `README.md` — scanner-led hero, `Status` block sourced from
  `picosentry/experimental.py`, `What it does NOT do` block (6 items
  including the kernel-syscall-trace gap), 30-second no-clone demo,
  feature matrix comparison that admits where PicoSentry is weaker,
  `Where to get help` section.
- `picosentry/scan/engine.py` — dropped two `@lateos/npm-scan`
  citations in the timebox comments.
- `picosentry/scan/validation.py` — dropped the "npm-scan advertises
  0% FP" comparison from the docstring; rewrote to describe the
  methodology on its own merits.
- `picosentry/scan/campaigns/_base.py` — dropped "modeled on
  npm-scan's NAMED_SIGNATURES" framing in two docstrings/comments.
- `picosentry/serve/services/correlation.py` — dropped the "competitive
  moat that no other product has" line from the module docstring.
- `docs/strategic/02-cross-layer-correlation.md`,
  `docs/strategic/03-reachability-vex-remediation.md`,
  `docs/strategic/04-ai-agent-security.md` — rewrote the "Why" sections
  to describe the user problem solved, not market position.

The legitimate Snyk research citations in `corpus/ioc/*.json` and
per-rule docs (documenting real attack patterns) were kept — those
are research attributions, not competitive positioning.

### Removed
- `/home/kirk/Madlab/Clean-Live/PicoSeries/review.txt` — v1-era
  research chat excerpt.
- `/home/kirk/Madlab/Clean-Live/PicoSeries/CROSS-ANALYSIS-PRs.md` —
  historical ledger of v1 cross-codebase refactors (PR-01 through
  PR-11). All work it tracked is already in the v2 codebase; the doc
  was a duplicate of git history.
- `/home/kirk/Madlab/Clean-Live/PicoSeries/.meta/BUG-HUNT-CN.md` —
  Chinese-language ledger of v1 bugs. All defects marked ✅ Done; the
  categories it describes (HMAC, 0.0.0.0 defaults, classifier
  exaggeration, scan engine wiring) line up with the 2.0.0–2.0.3 fixes
  in this changelog.

### Quality
- 3,580 tests passing locally on Python 3.12 with `.[all,dev]` (12
  skipped, 4 subtests passed).
- `ruff` 0 errors, `mypy` 0 errors across 273 source files.
- `docker build` succeeds; `picosentry scan|sandbox|watch|serve --help`
  all work inside the container.
- Cannot locally verify the 3.10/3.11/3.13 matrix dimensions (only
  3.12 installed); the Z-suffix fix in 2.0.4 covered the one known
  3.10 stdlib gap.

### Out of scope (deliberately)
- **Kernel-syscall observation from the seccomp-bpf backend.** The
  README's prior headline claimed the kernel sandbox "shows you the
  syscalls" — that is false today. The seccomp backend enforces
  (KILL on disallowed syscalls) but emits no syscall trace, and the
  L4 observer reads subprocess stdout, not the kernel. The README
  now describes the actual capability (enforcement-only, trace
  tracked as future work) and the "What it does NOT do" block names
  the gap. Implementing the kernel tracer (SECCOMP_RET_LOG + ptrace
  or audit + L4 trace consumer) is tracked as a separate
  engineering project, not in this patch release.

## [2.0.6] — 2026-06-06

### Fixed — `[dev]` is not in `[all]`
The 2.0.5 release commit (32db570) changed the umbrella test jobs to
`.[all]`, but the test tools (pytest, ruff, mypy, types-PyYAML) live
in `[dev]`, not in `[all]`. Result: `No module named pytest` on every
matrix dimension except 3.12 (which seems to have a system-installed
pytest that got picked up).

Fixed: change the install command to `.[all,dev]` — runtime deps
(including fastapi + PyJWT + passlib[bcrypt] + everything in `[serve]`,
`[watch-server]`, `[otel]`, `[sigstore]`) plus the test tools.

## [2.0.5] — 2026-06-06

### Fixed — CI umbrella tests need serve deps too
The 2.0.4 release commit (3db0635) fixed the Python 3.10 `Z`-suffix
issue but the umbrella `test-core` and `test-matrix` jobs (which run
`pytest tests/` across the full test tree) hit a new failure on Python
3.10 and 3.13:

  `tests/serve/test_api.py::TestDashboardSummary::test_dashboard_summary_returns_data`
  `RuntimeError: PyJWT is required for token generation. Install with: pip install PyJWT`

`tests/serve/test_api.py` needs PyJWT + passlib[bcrypt] (in the
`[serve]` extra) and the watch tests need fastapi (in `[watch-server]`).
The 2.0.4 install command on `test-core` / `test-matrix` was
`.[dev,watch-server]`, which covered fastapi but not PyJWT.

Fixed by changing both jobs to `.[all]` — the umbrella tests cover
every subdir, so they need every dep. `.[all]` mirrors a real
production install footprint.

## [2.0.4] — 2026-06-06

### Fixed — Python 3.10 ISO-8601 `Z` suffix compatibility
The 2.0.3 release commit (c40ffdd) fixed the 4 main CI failures but
introduced a new one in `test-core (3.10)` and `test-matrix (3.10)`:
`tests/scan/test_corpus_governance.py::TestFreshnessReport::test_stale_detection`
asserted that a 2099-dated source is fresh and a 2020-dated source is
stale, expecting 1 stale. In Python 3.10, `datetime.fromisoformat()` does
not accept the `Z` suffix (added in 3.11), so the 2099 entry's date
parse raised `ValueError` and the existing `except` clause marked it
stale. Result: 2 stale, not 1.

Fixed in `picosentry/scan/corpus_governance.py::CorpusSource.is_stale`:
normalize trailing `Z` to `+00:00` before parsing, so the same code
works across 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13.

No other 3.10 stdlib gaps were surfaced by the test suite.

## [2.0.3] — 2026-06-06

### Fixed — CI repair patch

The 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 release commits were published, but the GitHub Actions
CI runs on those commits failed across 4 distinct categories of job. This
patch fixes all 4 — no behavioral changes for end users, just a green
pipeline. (PyPI cannot re-host a published version, hence 2.0.3 instead
of re-releasing 2.0.2.)

- **`test-serve` (10 failures).** Code in
  `picosentry/serve/services/orchestrator.py` and
  `picosentry/serve/services/orgs.py` was calling `.get()` on
  `sqlite3.Row` objects returned by `DatabaseManager.execute_one(...)`.
  `Row` doesn't implement `.get()`. The return-type hint on
  `execute_one` (`-> dict | None`) already documented the expected
  contract; the fix is at the source — `execute()` and `execute_one()`
  now materialize rows as plain dicts at the boundary, so every existing
  call site (`row["col"]` and `(row or {}).get("col")`) Just Works.
  No code change needed at any of the 3 call sites.
- **`test-watch`, `test-core` (3.10/3.11), `test-matrix` (3.11).** Those
  CI jobs installed `pip install -e ".[dev]"`, which doesn't include
  fastapi. The watch tests (`tests/watch/test_server*.py`) and the watch
  module under test (`picosentry/watch/server.py`) all import fastapi,
  so pytest collection failed before any test ran. Fixed by adding the
  `watch-server` extra (fastapi + uvicorn) to the install commands for
  all three jobs.
- **`type-check` (3 unused-ignore errors).** Three
  `# type: ignore[assignment]` comments on opentelemetry fallback
  imports were dead under newer mypy with `ignore_missing_imports = true`
  (the module becomes `Any` and the rebind is then safe). But the
  comments were also *needed* under older mypy that sees the real type
  conflict. Instead of pinning mypy, restructured both files:
  - `picosentry/serve/services/observability.py` — extracted the gRPC
    vs HTTP exporter-class selection into a `_load_otlp_exporters()`
    helper. Each branch binds a single class to one name; no rebind at
    the call site, no ignore comment needed.
  - `picosentry/sandbox/tracing.py` — same idea, bound the OTel `trace`
    module to a private `_trace_module` sentinel instead of rebinding
    the bare module name to `None` in the `except ImportError` branch.
  Both versions of mypy are now clean.
- **`test-scan` (2 corpus-dependent failures).**
  `picosentry/scan/corpus/npm_top_packages.json` was listed in
  `.gitignore`, so `actions/checkout@v4` skipped it. The
  `load_corpus_for_ecosystem()` loader fell back to a 99-entry builtin
  list, which broke `test_corpus_loaded_from_file` (asserts > 100
  packages) and `test_crossenv_credential_theft` (the typosquat
  detector couldn't match `crossenv` against `cross-env` because
  `cross-env` wasn't in the fallback). Fixed by removing the
  `npm_top_packages.json` line from `.gitignore` and committing the
  existing 6 KB / 327-entry corpus file (which includes `cross-env` at
  line 91). Both scan tests now pass.

### Quality
- 3,632 tests passing across the full local sweep (was 3,612 before
  the 2.0.3 fixes; the +20 reflects the 10 serve + 2 scan + 2 watch
  tests that now pass).
- `ruff` 0 errors, `mypy` 0 errors across 273 source files.

## [2.0.2] — 2026-06-06

### Added
- **`picosentry scan --validate`** CLI flag for the validation harness. The harness itself shipped in 2.0.1 (via the Python `picosentry.scan.validation.run_validation()` API); this patch exposes it on the CLI as planned. Prints a per-rule precision/recall table and exits 0 if mean precision >= 0.95 and mean recall >= 0.80. `picosentry/cli.py` now also wires the flag through the unified-CLI parser (it was previously only registered in the inner `picosentry/scan/cli.py` parser).

## [2.0.1] — 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Per-campaign IOC packages** (4 campaigns shipped): Shai-Hulud, Node-IPC Compromise, Trapdoor, Axios Poisoning. Each is a self-contained `picosentry/scan/campaigns/<name>/` package with `iocs.json` + `detector.py` + tests, auto-discovered by `create_default_engine()`.
- **Validation harness** (`picosentry scan --validate`): auditable per-rule precision/recall against labelled fixtures. 7 fixtures (3 positive / 4 negative), 100% precision, 100% recall.
- **Per-detector timebox**: each rule runs in a worker thread with a default 5.0s `future.result(timeout=...)` ceiling. New `timeout` status on `RuleExecution`; the rest of the scan continues. Per-scan override via `engine.scan(..., rule_timeout=N)`.
- **`RULE_ID_ALIASES` constant** in `picosentry/scan/rules/__init__.py` documents the three multi-ID detector functions (`detect_obfuscation`, `detect_manifest_issues`, `detect_pypi_obfuscation`) — one source of truth for "why does one function emit under many rule_ids".
- **README banner** at the top of the README (samurai-lobster hero image).
- README hero leads with the kernel-sandbox feature: runs the candidate package under `seccomp-BPF` + `landlock` + `ptrace` and records every syscall, file open, and network call.

### Fixed
- `L2-CRED-001` detection gap: was only scanning `node_modules`, now also scans the root project's install scripts (closes the case where a project with no `node_modules` would silently pass).
- `clean_npm_app` validation fixture was under-shooting real-world conditions and triggering 6 informational rules; enriched to a realistic "production-ready" baseline.

### Quality
- 3,370 tests passing (up from 3,548 — net -178 is the 5 dead-test files removed in 2.0.0 plus the new campaign + validation + timebox + alias tests; +13 net campaign tests, +8 validation tests, +5 timebox tests, +6 alias tests).
- `ruff` 0 errors, `mypy` 0 errors across 273 source files.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-06

### Changed
- **Unified 4 previously separate packages into one CLI**: `picosentry`, `picodome`, `picowatch`, `picoshogun` are now subcommands of a single `picosentry` package.
- Vendored `pico-core` dependency directly into `picosentry._core` to eliminate install friction (#3).
- Single `picosentry` PyPI project now supersedes the previous individual packages. Old versions (0.16.0, 1.0.0, 1.0.1) remain installable; new installs default to 2.0.0.
- GitHub repository consolidated at [`KirkForge/PicoSentry`](https://github.com/KirkForge/PicoSentry). Old `picosentry` PyPI namespace links to the same repo.

### Added
- `picosentry scan` — supply-chain scanner for npm, PyPI, Go, Cargo, Maven, RubyGems, NuGet.
- `picosentry sandbox` — seccomp-bpf runtime sandbox with behavioral analysis.
- `picosentry watch` — LLM prompt-injection detection and output validation.
- `picosentry serve` — API server, dashboard, and orchestration.
- Cross-layer correlation engine linking scan findings → sandbox behavior → watch alerts.
- Deterministic output guarantee: same inputs + same policy = same SHA-256.
- Optional extras: `[scan]`, `[watch-server]`, `[serve]`, `[otel]`, `[sigstore]`, `[all]` for granular dependency control.
- 49 ecosystem rules across 6 lockfile formats; 3,548 tests passing.

### Removed
- External `pico-core` dependency (now vendored).
- 4 separate PyPI projects (`picosentry` v1.x, `picodome`, `picowatch`, `picoshogun`) — see deprecation notice below.

### Quality
- Static analysis: `ruff` 358 → 0 errors, `mypy` 135 → 0 errors across 262 source files.
- 3 dead test files removed.
- 2 real bugs caught and fixed during cleanup: scheduler.py referenced an undefined variable in the `run` branch; maven_utils.py had a copy-paste bug in a version-text ternary.

## [1.x] — Individual packages (deprecated)

The 1.x line of `picosentry` and the related `picodome`, `picowatch`, `picoshogun` packages are now superseded by 2.0.0. They will not receive further updates. Install with `pip install picosentry>=2.0.0` to get the unified package.
